Ideas relating to finance , economics , politics , society , are very often tainted by people &apos;s personal ideologies .
And what starts happening is that , around young suns , young stars , all these elements combine , they swirl around , the energy of the star stirs them around , they form particles , they form snowflakes , they form little dust motes , they form rocks , they form asteroids , and eventually , they form planets and moons .
But why is this so interesting ? Here &apos;s the quick story .
This is Iraq .
I think I &apos;m going to stay for 35 . Maybe -- maybe I &apos;ll die .

It &apos;s about 1.2 million cubic feet of compressed air .
Now that seems kind of mundane , but think about how in real life , if we &apos;re having a conversation and we want to change the topic , there are ways of doing it gracefully .

We didn &apos;t let the stores know we were coming .
Now the same insights can also be exploited -- with respect to networks -- can also be exploited in other ways , for example , in the use of targeting specific people for interventions .
A good reader has an artist &apos;s passion , a willingness to get caught up in the story , but just as importantly , the readers also needs the coolness of judgment of a scientist , which acts to temper and complicate the reader &apos;s intuitive reactions to the story .

I finally went down there , and it was this old rusted circular thing , and two beds , and very kind of creepy and weird .
But he was worried that all we seem to be doing is trading opinions about this .

I guess these are the questions people are going to answer .
And we kept building , and that is the result .
Their ratio tells us the water temperature .

So unless we act , unless we do something today , we will soon be faced &#91; with &#93; what some have termed the treatment time bomb .
So this burden of knowledge drives me .
It &apos;s a precise specification with a precise formal language that causes Mathematica to know what to do here .

Let everyone ride in a golf cart if they want to .
So we need to acknowledge that despite the dubious statistics , despite the fact that 84 percent of people in Britain feel politics is broken , despite the fact that when I was in Iraq , we did an opinion poll in 2003 and asked people what political systems they preferred , and the answer came back that seven percent wanted the United States , five percent wanted France , three percent wanted Britain , and nearly 40 percent wanted Dubai , which is , after all , not a democratic state at all but a relatively prosperous minor monarchy , democracy is a thing of value for which we should be fighting .

And the way to ask that question is to look at the Neanderthal that comes from Southern Europe and compare it to genomes of people who live today .
But such ardent watchfulness can lead to anxiety , so much so that years later , when I was investigating why so many young black men were diagnosed with schizophrenia , six times more than they ought to be , I was not surprised to hear the psychiatrist say , &quot; Black people are schooled in paranoia . &quot;

So here &apos;s another one .
Just the basic feeling .
Combine that with a world value survey , which measures the political opinions and , fortunately for me , the savings behaviors of millions of families in hundreds of countries around the world .
Then we also wanted to look at other ways of using land in addition to growing food and transforming landscape into much more productive uses , so that it could be used for storm water management , for example , by using surface lakes and retention ponds , that created neighborhood amenities , places of recreation , and actually helped to elevate adjacent property levels .
But you know what ?
But using some of these same methods , we can look at the NSA &apos;s data centers , and figure out , you know , we don &apos;t know what &apos;s going on there , but it &apos;s pretty clear that their operation is not the size of Google &apos;s .

Brought in a team from the U.K. -- there &apos;s a lot of great refrigeration people , it turned out , in the U.K. -- and built a test rig , and proved that , in fact , we could make a low pressure , non-toxic refrigerator .
It &apos;s all peach and pine and calming colors .
The treatment for this is amputation .

So the thought is , hey , maybe what we should do is just immediately -- we hear there is H5N1 spreading from human to human , the virus has mutated to be a human-to-human transmitter -- let &apos;s shut down the airports .
But David &apos;s young and he &apos;s smart and he wants a Ph.D. , and he proceeds to build -- He proceeds to build the first ever liquid metal battery of this chemistry .

She &apos;s an Italian fashion designer .
That rule lives in your brain .
Tech enthusiast Kevin Kelly asks &quot; What does technology want ? &quot; and discovers that its movement toward ubiquity and complexity is much like the evolution of life .
We had one on the shuttle and one on the International Space Station , for 16 months , where we managed to produce the first organisms to go through complete multiple life cycles in space -- really pushing the envelope of understanding how malleable our life systems are .
Another is to change our lifestyles .
We &apos;re reading the book of life .
Now , I tell them , a paper has four different sections : an introduction , a methods , a results , a discussion .
And in fact , there &apos;s this other group of people who are not as divided as people might think , and that group is economists .
Sargasso Sea &apos;s three million square miles of floating forest is being gathered up to feed cows .
Twenty-five-and-a-quarter years ago I read a newspaper article which said that one day syringes would be one of the major causes of the spread of AIDS , the transmission of AIDS .
I want to convince you that humans are , to some extent , natural born essentialists .
And you can see the vascular tree that remains intact .
This is the craft that was going on , but there are a few collectors who also collect art which can depreciate .
Every year or so , I have the privilege of taking clinicians into the Himalayas and the Tibetan Plateau .
So if we &apos;d chosen that path , our evolutionary path would have led into the forest -- and been a short one indeed .
And Mahmoud was coming every day .
Faiza &apos;s story is just one of hundreds I &apos;ve heard over the years , traveling across the Arab region talking to people about sex .
Others reacted in asking you for help , and some people hide from you .
And there was something fundamental that they were missing .
You know what else makes my role particularly challenging ?
I started reacting , but then I tried to remember to go to the balcony .
Jake : &quot; Haha . Slash I &apos;m watching this video with suns players trying to shoot with one eye . &quot;
We open ourselves up to those opportunities , and in this room are key players and technology , key players who are uniquely positioned to do this , to scale systems and projects together .
I went , &quot; Wait a minute , all right , right -- I &apos;ll get the wheels . &quot; Purely out of protest , I got the flashy wheels , and I installed them and -- check this out . Could I have my special light cue please ?
And on each ballot form there is this encrypted value in the form of this 2D barcode on the right .
This leads to this question .
It &apos;s what the dentist cleans off your teeth every time that you go in for a visit .
And the United States up there is getting for longer life , keeping family size . And in the &apos; 80s now , they give up communist planning and they go for market economy , and it moves faster even than social life . And today , we have in Vietnam the same life expectancy and the same family size here in Vietnam , 2003 , as in United States , 1974 , by the end of the war .
Without this ability there is no magic .
And that &apos;s what I say when people ask me what I do , but it really confuses most people , so really , the best way for me to convey it is to take the technology and be creative and create experiences .
The legendary design team Charles and Ray Eames made films , houses and classic midcentury modern furniture . Eames Demetrios , their grandson , shows rarely seen films and archival footage in a lively , loving tribute to their creative process .
It &apos;s about retelling the story of the poor , and it &apos;s about giving ourselves an opportunity to engage that validates their dignity , validates a partnership relationship , not a relationship that &apos;s based on the traditional sort of donor beneficiary weirdness that can happen .
You can use flour and water , or cornstarch and water .
Now , that free time existed in the 20th century , but we didn &apos;t get Ushahidi in the 20th century .
And even without sight , I don &apos;t get that in San Francisco .
And the answer is that not only do you slow down technological progress , you can actually throw it into reverse .
So this is gallbladder surgery .
When I became president in 1993 , there were none of these organizations in Russia .
And the community , the medical community there said , &quot; We &apos;ve said this for the last decade . We know this .
As the demand for donor organs continues to rise , in large part due to the aging population , the supply has remained relatively constant .
The fun part is , I &apos;m going to the Boston metro , and playing a pong game inside the train on the ground , right ?
Thank you .
And if we want to understand who we are and how we feel and perceive , we really understand what brains are .
We need to savor vegetables .
So what we did is we put two capuchin monkeys side-by-side .
And while that idea may be disquieting , and while parasites &apos; habits may be very grisly , I think that ability to surprise us makes them as wonderful and as charismatic as any panda or butterfly or dolphin .
So as you go further away from the Sun , this becomes more and more powerful .
I didn &apos;t just trigger something which sounds like that .
There &apos;s actually a scientist carefully controlling Nexi &apos;s cues to be able to study this question .
Three years later , we have the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Waterloo , Ontario . It &apos;s the most exciting job I &apos;ve ever had .

Robert Full : That &apos;s what she did on rough surfaces .
A lot of the information is good .
Let &apos;s look at the squares of the first few Fibonacci numbers .
&quot; But why ? &quot; I asked him .
I want you all to think about the third word that was ever said about you , or if you were delivering , about the person you were delivering .
So ever since then , before I would go anywhere , I would call the FBI .
&quot; Henry , what &apos;s your question ? &quot;
First , what do good arguers win when they win an argument ?

Erick is known as the Batman .
Was there a God ?
I live opposite a farm . And this was the runt of the litter , a piglet that died .

So I want to ask you first , you know , both to try power posing , and also I want to ask you to share the science , because this is simple .
So in the Charles Bonnet hallucinations , you have all sorts of levels , from the geometrical hallucinations -- the pink and blue squares the woman had -- up to quite elaborate hallucinations with figures and especially faces .
But first a little bit about this group of artists , scientists , and engineers that are working together .
And many of his own supporters on his own site went very publicly berserk .
Malcolm Gladwell : The strange tale of the Norden bombsight
That &apos;s what makes me get up every day and want to think about this generation of black artists and artists around the world .

Audience : Hello . I read somewhere that in the last 20 years , the average lifespan of basically anyone on the planet has grown by 10 years .
But the bigger issue is that global gridlock is going to stifle economic growth and our ability to deliver food and health care , particularly to people that live in city centers .
And our friend , Betty Edwards , the &quot; Drawing on the Right Side of the Brain &quot; lady , shows these two tables to her drawing class and says , &quot; The problem you have with learning to draw is not that you can &apos;t move your hand , but that the way your brain perceives images is faulty .
She &apos;s desperately poor .
So look to the right-hand side of the screen .
But the third pillar that he talked about was design .
So we were using the body as really the catalyst to help us to make lots of new bone .
But in 2007 , at the height of the sub-prime and all the complicated financial structures , it was quite opposite to the reckless risk-taking behaviors that we saw on the market .
I &apos;m going to show you something pretty unique .
And so we finally ended up making it .
Over two million people became refugees .
This is a face-scanning sphere , with 156 white LEDs all around that allow us to photograph her in a series of very controlled illumination conditions .
But the world isn &apos;t a fairy tale , and it could be more brutal than we want to acknowledge .
Let me show you a couple of examples here .
I meet with lots of people on the ground and Bill &apos;s taught me to take that and read up to the global data and see if they match , and I think what I &apos;ve taught him is to take that data and meet with people on the ground to understand , can you actually deliver that vaccine ?
Okay , the closest living relative of the passenger pigeon is the band-tailed pigeon . They &apos;re abundant . There &apos;s some around here .
You hear about , actually , a drone pilot , a hobbyist , was attacked two weeks ago because he was flying near a beach .
And I &apos;m applying a similar trick to say , what if we looked at the universe in our culture through the eyes of technology ? What does technology want ?
Let &apos;s hope it &apos;s really stable .
Now , when I heard about one animal , I knew we had to get it for my next series , Untamed Americas , for National Geographic .
Johanna Blakley : Lessons from fashion &apos;s free culture
But even in modern times , relations have been close at times .
Every day , 24 hours , that pump is at your side , administering medicine directly to your heart , and it &apos;s not a particularly preferable medicine in many senses .

This is a song that I wrote last year .
And so this is a Philippe Starck juicer , produced by Alessi .
Our world is defined by the pace of change .
Now she &apos;s the best student , not just in our school , but in the entire division that we are in .
We &apos;d like to understand that .
Those are the things to be provided by the business community .
And it &apos;s what story cutting is all about .
Anyway .
For the next three dozen years as king , this king actually started measuring and managing around happiness in Bhutan -- including , just recently , taking his country from being an absolute monarchy to a constitutional monarchy with no bloodshed , no coup .
Over this time frame , Ted has continued to hold a full-time job . Bill hasn &apos;t .
The most interesting discovery of late , I think is the so-called immortal jellyfish , which has actually been observed in the lab to be able to be able to revert back to the polyp state after reaching full maturity .
I propose we look to nature .
Whether or not that &apos;s due to an individual &apos;s genetic background or their experiences , we don &apos;t know .
Another example : a little bit more mathematical .
Beauty is an adaptive effect , which we extend and intensify in the creation and enjoyment of works of art and entertainment .
That &apos;s 58 billion dollars .
What makes something wrong ?
I felt unworthy of stepping across the gates of the university , because I wasn &apos;t like Einstein or Newton or any other scientist whose results I had learned about , because in science , we just learn about the results , not the process .
Thank you .
The reality is , the folks I described as the master teachers , the master narrative builders , the master storytellers are far removed from classrooms .
Now today , I told you about very strange and weird protocells -- some that contain clay , some that have primordial ooze in them , some that have basically oil instead of water inside of them .
We love things like plot twists and red herrings and surprise endings .
But after a very short while , you can see these blue things on the right there begin to take over .
Some million years after -- pshoo-shoo , bloop-bloop -- ah , wake up !
Rio has 6.3 million inhabitants -- More than 20 percent , 1.4 million , live in the favelas .
An innovator is one who does not know it cannot be done .
So , as usual , what we see just beyond the horizon is full of promise and peril .
Anyone who &apos;s from England knows the reputation we have from Essex .
So that when there was a sudden accidental discovery by one member of the group , say the use of fire , or a particular type of tool , instead of dying out , this spread rapidly , horizontally across the population , or was transmitted vertically , down the generations .
Nobody knows .
We &apos;re using the kind of skills that I &apos;ve outlined : inner power -- the development of inner power -- through self-knowledge , recognizing and working with our fear , using anger as a fuel , cooperating with others , banding together with others , courage , and most importantly , commitment to active non-violence .
In the middle of this chaos , I &apos;m rolling around in a wheelchair , and I was completely invisible . Completely .
Don Draper only wishes he was as elegant and precise as the emerald cockroach wasp .
You had this same thing in America , it was called the Timex Sinclair1000 .
Because if you can get the gene for green fluorescent protein and deliver it to a cell , that cell will glow green -- or any of the many variants now of green fluorescent protein , you get a cell to glow many different colors .
BJ : And then of course , the challenge is knowing when to turn around .
From there with all the skills and knowledge from paragliding and all the different disciplines in skydiving , I went on to BASE jumping .
This is what really kind of gets everybody hating you is because you &apos;re trying to extract money from all your friends all the time .
That &apos;s all we could do .
But how many did we do the first one ? 12 .
See , when you get close they &apos;re really just blobs of paint .
And 20,000 kids have been taken away to become child soldiers , and the International Criminal Court is going after five of the leaders of the -- now , what &apos;s it called ?
I mean it &apos;s been 25 years .
Oh ... &quot;
And that silence just outside a doctor &apos;s office , that many of us know .
About from a hundred feet away , this is what I hear : &quot; Vulnerability TED ! Vulnerability TED ! &quot;
But let &apos;s just think through what the science is telling us is likely to happen .
As the medieval knight Antonius Block returns from the wild goose chase of the Crusades and arrives on the rocky shore of Sweden , only to find the specter of death waiting for him , Mr. Teszler sat in the dark with his fellow students . And as death opened his cloak to embrace the knight in a ghastly embrace , I heard Mr. Teszler &apos;s tremulous voice : &quot; Uh oh , &quot; he said , &quot; This doesn &apos;t look so good . &quot;
So if I talk up here in my nose , you can hear the difference .
And this is , of course , the culture where we have developed something that I like to call socio-cultural regulation .
And it won &apos;t be easy -- that &apos;s for sure .
So that &apos;s what we &apos;re going to do .
The second point I would like for you to consider is the standard of care that is provided to participants within any clinical trial .
You don &apos;t have to dig deep down underground .
We take them and rip them out of their native environment , throw them in one of these dishes , and expect them to work .
You should care about your posture -- this is not right .

It &apos;s the only paper that will ever be freely accessible by this journal .
I couldn &apos;t wait to prove the athlete I am , that nobody else in the world can do this swim .
As businesses , are the economic offerings you are providing -- are they true to themselves ?
And so I thought that was interesting .
I mean , of course , this is how Americans take it , so people all over the Middle East , not just in your country , are protesting .
The last time that was the case was actually a century ago , during the Ottoman Empire .
And she realized that she had the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , where we not only can feed , clothe and house ourselves , but also provide for wild birds so they don &apos;t go hungry in the winter .
I said , &quot; Well , just short of 1.5 . &quot;
However , once we eliminate public funding for the arts , there will be some drawbacks .
But maybe there &apos;s another benefit there as well .
But what we &apos;re going to talk about in this is how we &apos;re going to the next level .
And the reason that I think that those words are interesting is because those were the same kinds of words that were used for people who decided they would end slavery , or end apartheid .
They want to earn a living .
On the other side of the planet , in the Amazon , we &apos;ve got many tribes which practice what anthropologists call partible paternity .
And we have a high hope in you . Thank you very much .
They don &apos;t usually like to go into water that is very cloudy anyway .
And I &apos;m going to suggest to you that &apos;s not nearly enough , in just a moment .
One-sixth of humanity is there . It &apos;s soon going to be more than that .
In reality , it was the beginning of the end for him .
And so in Isaiah , we have the wonderful texts giving all the credit of this , not to Marduk but to the Lord God of Israel -- the Lord God of Israel who also called Cyrus by name , also takes Cyrus by the hand and talks of him shepherding his people .
The whole first year was pass / fail , but the second year was graded .
Or we &apos;ll be here all day with my childhood stories .
Again we see that there &apos;s only a small number of symbols that people are actually using in their passwords .
Or , finally , it can be more fully active -- as I know subsequent speakers will also talk about today -- where people might globally participate in wikis , or photographing , or monitoring elections , and upload information in a way that allows us to pool information in order to understand social processes and social phenomena .
Clay was with us in Port-au-Prince . He was also with us in Chile .
So that was at eight o &apos;clock at night .
So on that frame , the children who are typical are watching this , the emotion of expression of that little boy as he &apos;s fighting a little bit with the little girl .
Please ask them to treat us like human beings . &quot;
We know about man &apos;s impact on the ocean in terms of fishing and overfishing , but we don &apos;t really know much about what &apos;s happening underneath the water .
The problem is that the men under his care are suffering from an excruciating and debilitating condition that Archie doesn &apos;t really understand .
We want every girl to experience the dance , right ? &quot;
I have dropped a blob of organic yogurt from happy self-actualized local cows on my counter top , and I grab a paper towel and I want to wipe it up .
Thank you . That was it , by the way .
You &apos;ll never find Indian women so precise .
We started running very low on food . We were both pretty hungry , losing lots of weight .
Even the idea of us as a family was challenging to most people .
So here &apos;s the video .
It &apos;s about any kind of ideology , any kind of idea that tells you that you can attain virtue by controlling what you do with your body , by controlling what you put into your body .
It keeps the temperature in your house the same as the weather changes outside .
And something changes for Tony .
JM : Now a little piece of career advice .
Artist iO Tillett Wright has photographed 2,000 people who consider themselves somewhere on the LGBTQ spectrum and asked many of them : Can you assign a percentage to how gay or straight you are ? Most people , it turns out , consider themselves to exist in the gray areas of sexuality , not 100 % gay or straight . Which presents a real problem when it comes to discrimination : Where do you draw the line ?
That is efficiency .
I might get one of those .
They charge a flat annual maintenance fee of just 20 Euros .
Which means that each and every one of you here today knows at least one child that is suffering from a developmental disorder .
And that &apos;s okay .
So , the idea is that if we fly around the world in a solar powered airplane , using absolutely no fuel , nobody ever could say in the future that it &apos;s impossible to do it for cars , for heating systems , for computers , and so on and so on .
165 .
Okay , some of you are looking a little bit skeptical .
The spacing is something else .
Guests ? Move the moving wall , have some fold-down guest beds .
So , it &apos;s easy to find the good stuff , and when you &apos;ve found it , you can watch it in close-up repeatedly and read what hundreds of people have written about it .
What are the environments that lead to unusual levels of innovation , unusual levels of creativity ?
JE : And in theory , that means that , as a mouse feels , smells , hears , touches , you can model it out as a string of ones and zeros .
If you &apos;d loan me your Gulfstream , I &apos;ll rip its wings off and generate you a megawatt .
Of course , now I &apos;m very sensitive at home when we leave the lights on by mistake .
Just like T.B. , but the object is behavior change .
See , some people might fear girls not liking them back .
The chair could collapse if you sit on it , the apple might be poison , the dog might not bark , and in fact , this is my dog Tessie , who doesn &apos;t bark .
This is simply the wealth of a country versus the percent of population over the age of 65 .
Anatomists were arguing very much about that .
You can only determine relatedness by looking for similarities .
And the object is forced to continue to collapse to an infinitely small object .
There &apos;s very little evidence to suggest it , but what he did say is actually far nicer , and again , I &apos;ve printed this . I &apos;m going to read it out .
You &apos;ve heard the impact of resource extraction , human noise and habitat destruction .
So we recently presented the master plan , and it has gotten approved .
However , there was a silver lining .
First is the training , empowerment , and connection of defenders worldwide .
How many poets could cram eBay , Friendster and Monster.com into 3-minute poem worthy of a standing ovation ? Enjoy Rives &apos; unique talent .
It grows very slowly .
But the idea that we can gently grow there with a few minor hiccups is just wrong , and it &apos;s dangerously wrong , because it means we &apos;re not getting ready for what &apos;s really going to happen .
The small mountains in the foreground , they move more .
That girl can take her iPhone , put it on the robot , send an email to Grandma , who lives on the other side of the country .
We have about three fathers who have been trained to cook .
We have no excuse in this country . I &apos;m sorry .
I went there without knowing him . He was 35 . I was 23 .
And I suspect many of you gave something to the people of Haiti this year .
We put our toes in and we go up to our neck .
And it so happens that this is a product that , because of its nature , a business model to address this market requires you to guarantee to your producers that their product will be reliably placed in the markets where it is consumed .
This is called &quot; I &apos;m An Emotional Creature . &quot;
And to understand that , you have to understand a little bit about how stealth works .
In his new and visionary book , &quot; New Self , New World , &quot; the writer Philip Shepherd says , &quot; If you are divided from your body , you are also divided from the body of the world , which then appears to be other than you or separate from you , rather than the living continuum to which you belong . &quot;
One of our philosophies in the book is that no dish is really intrinsically any better than any other dish .
The only mistake lies in that I &apos;m not able to perceive what it is that someone else did .
I have my file which is called To Do . I have my plans .
One is , we can make better use of the oil that we have , and that &apos;s analogous to making better use of existing antibiotics , and we can do this in a number of ways that we &apos;ll talk about in a second , but the other option is the &quot; drill , baby , drill &quot; option , which in the case of antibiotics is to go find new antibiotics .
Well , I didn &apos;t have that in mind , so ...
Have some of it .
The interesting thing , the original thing , would be to threaten somebody with immortality .
It &apos;s easy to fool the brain in 2D .
He helped us understand that social media &apos;s becoming social production .
Now there are some cartoons that are puzzling .
Now this is going to be really important as we start getting to things like data visualization . For instance , I think we all really enjoyed Hans Rosling &apos;s talk , and he really emphasized the fact that I &apos;ve been thinking about for a long time too : we have all this great data , but for some reason , it &apos;s just sitting there .
I love trees , and I &apos;m very lucky , because we live near a wonderful arboretum , and Sundays , usually , I &apos;d go there with my wife and now , with my four-year-old , and we &apos;d climb in the trees , we &apos;d play hide and seek .
More recently , the U.S. government revealed that in September 2008 , more than 3 million people in the state of Espirito Santo in Brazil were plunged into darkness , victims of a blackmail operation from cyber pirates .
It &apos;s got an amazing user experience .
And on our third high-speed testing deployment on a bitter cold morning in upstate New York , we got to do that for the first time .
I didn &apos;t really want to , from the previous adventure .
Think about Amazon , Apple , Google , Starbucks .
In a world where media is global , social , ubiquitous and cheap , in a world of media where the former audience are now increasingly full participants , in that world , media is less and less often about crafting a single message to be consumed by individuals .
3D printing has grown in sophistication since the late 1970s ; TED Fellow Skylar Tibbits is shaping the next development , which he calls 4D printing , where the fourth dimension is time . This emerging technology will allow us to print objects that then reshape themselves or self-assemble over time . Think : a printed cube that folds before your eyes , or a printed pipe able to sense the need to expand or contract .
Tucked away on the right-hand side , you will see a dot of a country with a lot of GDP but not a huge amount of social progress — that &apos;s Kuwait .
You come back from vacation .
But audacious is what has happened many times before in history .
Over the last 13 years -- one , three , 13 years -- I &apos;ve been part of an exceptional team at InSightec in Israel and partners around the world for taking this idea , this concept , noninvasive surgery , from the research lab to routine clinical use .
For example , in the pharma industry , a lot of the molecules are being developed , but you see a major part of that work is being sent to India .
The region , the U.K. and the U.S. decide , has to be kept safe from communism , and the superpower that will be created to do this would be Iran , the Shah .
Now I may have used a tone which was more like a dare than a request — — but nonetheless , it &apos;s to this man &apos;s credit and his courage that he said , &quot; Yes , I will . &quot;
That &apos;s how most marketing is done , that &apos;s how most sales is done and that &apos;s how most of us communicate interpersonally .
There &apos;s the stamen and the pistil . But look what the stamen and the pistil look like in a microscope . That &apos;s the stamen .
Would he need the same language as a lawyer , for example ?
Billy Collins : No wonder you rise in the middle of the night to look up the date of a famous battle in a book on war .
And the richest people over there -- there &apos;s one billion people -- and they live above what I call the &quot; air line , &quot; because they spend more than $ 80 a day on their consumption .
But of course , with the use of technology .
So we said , &quot; If people are not sensitive to the economic rational theory explanations , to these forces , what could be going on ? &quot;
This is a wonderful thing .
In 1988 , at the University of Minnesota , I participated in a small series of whole organ pancreas transplants .

When that moves into polymers , you can change the elasticity , the fluidity of the form .
And so , I &apos;ll conclude by saying we &apos;ve looked at 20 people with schizophrenia .
Well to start to do this , we took a 3D printer and we started to print our beakers and our test tubes on one side and then print the molecule at the same time on the other side and combine them together in what we call reactionware .
Why not leverage the learnings that you &apos;ve been learning your entire life ?
I went around Toronto and found a bathtub like my grandmother &apos;s , and I put the fish in .

Compulsive gamblers are experts at self-deception .
I think it &apos;s always been wrong , because I think always creativity has been highly collaborative , and it &apos;s probably been largely interactive .
A coffee cup -- we don &apos;t think about coffee cups , but it &apos;s much more interesting than one might think -- a coffee cup is a device , which has a container and a handle .

So of course , this is a very crude machine , but we &apos;re working on a micro-scale version of these , and hopefully the cubes will be like a powder that you pour in .
There are 12 million blind children in our country -- who live in a world of darkness .
And then people say , &quot; We &apos;ve tried democracy . It doesn &apos;t really work .
I don &apos;t want a clunky answering machine ; I want the message it saves .
She said , &quot; What &apos;s that ? &quot;
They were horrified when they discovered they &apos;d really been left out all the time because the shows were rigged .
And we added three quotations , because with the first genome we were criticized for not trying to say something more profound than just signing the work .
And everything comes towards that , and they watch it creeping up , and they own that as it goes along .
And the performance of these things has gotten so good that if you think about vehicles a little bit differently , you can really change things .
So , the whole activity of working with my hands and creating objects is very much connected with not only the idea realm , but also with very much the feeling realm .
Or , my favorite , the &quot; Love you ; mean it . &quot;
On the other hand , if you &apos;re visiting an underdeveloped country , and 25 dollars buys you a gourmet meal , it &apos;s exorbitant for a Big Mac .
And so of course there &apos;s the mixed emotions .
On a scientific basis , it &apos;s more than just &quot; Power of Positive Thinking &quot; -- it has a horrible , horrible dark side . Like if you get ill , it &apos;s because you &apos;ve just been thinking negative thoughts .
What &apos;s common among these groups of cells is that they all produce the neurotransmitter dopamine .
So that allows cells to ooze along in the right directions .
It &apos;s an extraordinary phenomenon , but it &apos;s true .
And their fears completely changed , and their fears were not about , &quot; Am I going to get killed ? &quot;
How could it not have sunk in when they &apos;d been telling me ?
It shouldn &apos;t be that difficult .
She was like , &quot; Nope . Sorry . Women are worth it . &quot;
And there are 30 JusticeMakers throughout the world , from Sri Lanka to Swaziland to the DRC , who with five thousand dollars do amazing things , through SMS programs , through paralegal programs , through whatever they can do .
I think Thucydides really spoke to us very clearly in 430 B.C. He put it nicely .
So today , computer viruses and trojans , designed to do everything from stealing data to watching you in your webcam to the theft of billions of dollars .
No cities like you see today in Doha or Dubai or Abu Dhabi or Kuwait or Riyadh .
I expect a lot from food .
They &apos;ve gone back and they &apos;ve gotten their Master &apos;s of Education .
I &apos;ve tested the device on my grandfather for about a year now , and it &apos;s had a 100 percent success rate in detecting the over 900 known cases of his wandering .
It &apos;s probably not so likely , but regardless of what he does , he &apos;ll be able to make use of these design skills that he learned .
And this particular beach is Kailua Beach , the beach where our president and his family vacationed before moving to Washington .
Artist Raghava KK demos his new children &apos;s book for iPad with a fun feature : when you shake it , the story -- and your perspective -- changes . In this charming short talk , he invites all of us to shake up our perspective a little bit .
&quot; Good . &quot;
And this is -- well , at the time -- I did this 10 years ago -- that was 36 years after the Dalai Lama had left .
Essentially first , the protein would have to be found in all pancreatic cancers at high levels in the bloodstream in the earliest stages , but also only in cancer .
You &apos;re not asked .
For me , like millions of other people around the world today , English is an acquired language .
And scientists have gone on to form peer groups where they meet regularly and create a space to talk about the emotional and subjective things that happen as they &apos;re mentoring , as they &apos;re going into the unknown , and even started courses about the process of doing science , about going into the unknown together , and many other things .
We see the bad stories on CNN and Fox and all that , but we don &apos;t see the good stories .
There we go . Smart audience .
We can stand on the Earth and look up at the night sky and see stars with our bare eyes .
So what Accenture suddenly found so unattractive about that , I &apos;m not sure .
Now before I get into the details of how the voice is made and let you listen to it , I need to give you a real quick speech science lesson . Okay ?
Thank you .
So instead of how much you know about it , we could say , &quot; What can you ask about it ? &quot;
Familiarity destroys and trumps fear . Try it .
I love to swim so much that as an adult , I swim with a coach .
And one of the most interesting lessons I learned was that there is an experimental method that if you have a question you can create a replica of this question in some abstract way , and you can try to examine this question , maybe learn something about the world .
The bar is called the Miracle of Science .
This time it &apos;s on the intensive care ward when a twentysomething resident that I &apos;ve never met before tells me that Terence is dying , perhaps tonight .
Fifteen years ago , the average American had three good friends .
Peter Eigen : How to expose the corrupt
And it seems that the only thing left for me to say is to thank you all for your kindness .
Whales in our waters are still low in numbers , however , because they do face a range of other human-induced threats .
You would think this wouldn &apos;t be too hard , that we would simply have the ability to take this fundamental information that we &apos;re learning about how it is that basic biology teaches us about the causes of disease and build a bridge across this yawning gap between what we &apos;ve learned about basic science and its application , a bridge that would look maybe something like this , where you &apos;d have to put together a nice shiny way to get from one side to the other .
Then we tried extracts , and lo and behold , we can steer insects to different directions .
I &apos;m going to talk about the role we members of society play in this phenomenon , and about four different response levels we citizens have against violence .
When you walked into those rooms , they smelled really bad , and our data suggests that it had something to do with leaving behind the airborne bacterial soup from people the day before .
It becomes the rainstorm .
If I would have been born a hundred years earlier , the big decisions in my life would have been made for me -- meaning I would have stayed in the town that I was born in ; I would have very much likely entered the same profession that my dad did ; and I would have very much likely married a woman that my mom had selected .
These are four 8.2 meter telescopes .
Indeed , mental illnesses are also very damaging to people &apos;s lives , but beyond just the burden of disease , let us consider the absolute numbers .
So let &apos;s just run through these guys .
She &apos;s a Polish poet .
Warren : I am not a golfer .
Now , what &apos;s wrong with shape is summarized in this slide .
JB : It &apos;s so powerful . Richard Ford , who &apos;s won the Pulitzer Prize , says that dyslexia helped him write sentences .
Back then , yes , I guess we all know now that it is essentially the sphere of life around the Earth , right ?
I came up with a pyramid eventually , that I don &apos;t have the time to go on that .
PM : And did you get pushback from making that a central tenant of foreign policy ?
What happened ?
But I think that the greater good is being served here by just allowing people -- there are very few places , now , where you can go and not have identity , to be completely anonymous and say whatever you &apos;d like .
They are stopped when they go to school , and it &apos;s disgusting .
They extract what they can , which is mostly the metals -- circuit boards and so forth -- and they leave behind mostly what they can &apos;t recover , which is , again , mostly the plastics .
So again , the physical cessation of life is not the same as death .
In terms of the political changes , they have introduced village elections .
The focus was around the patient .
You just know that you have certain beliefs .
But there &apos;s some things that have been going on since this idea of food was established .
And as I looked at it , it kind of tucked its arms under it , raised into a spherical shape and turned chocolate brown with two white stripes .
So rather than asking , as precaution would demand , what can we do as quickly as possible to avoid potential catastrophe , we ask bizarre questions like this : &quot; What is the latest possible moment we can wait before we begin seriously lowering emissions ?
She knew that meant she wouldn &apos;t have a future .
And was Silvia Gaus right ?
It just seemed that it was possible .
And this is a rainy election day in a small country -- that can be my country , but could be also your country .
And there &apos;s video analytics that are tracking our movements .
The carbon story here is a really good one .
So we were able to call Rita , clear the video , make sure that it had been shot , and then our clients were delighted because they were able to run it without being worried .
China , the same thing .
We &apos;re not trying to control polio .
And this is the paradigm that we see throughout the universe .
Everybody else was wandering around with mobile phones that looked like bricks and sort of smelly fish happening down on the port .
Employees volunteer time in the advice booth .
So I just copied and pasted from my résumé .
Those side effects accumulate and eventually cause pathology .
There &apos;s really no ceremony , rituals , or rites .
He quoted the words of all kinds of people who &apos;d had a variety of these experiences .
I &apos;m a social psychologist . I study prejudice , and I teach at a competitive business school , so it was inevitable that I would become interested in power dynamics .
It &apos;s a fantastic story of life on the earth .
Because it &apos;s working , put me in a poster now .
Well , this is actually what we &apos;re headed towards : world machines .
But you don &apos;t do this . &quot;
The U.S. is tied for 15th in reading , but we &apos;re 23rd in science and 31st in math .
: Video clips from across the globe .
When I began recording over four decades ago , I could record for 10 hours and capture one hour of usable material , good enough for an album or a film soundtrack or a museum installation .
I started this with community support .
I myself had a tumor removed from my large intestine when I was only 14 .
It &apos;s a ridiculous thing . It is absolutely ridiculous .
So the People &apos;s Building , as we called it .

What drives our desire to behave morally ? Neuroeconomist Paul Zak shows why he believes oxytocin is responsible for trust , empathy and other feelings that help build a stable society .
I lived in a society that was very clitoris-centric .
And there was a little -- an interesting theory about abstraction .
Thank you very much .
And in my case , as I was about five years old , this meant asking my mum .
&quot; Safer ? Why ? They have posted more policemen here ? &quot;
Things got a bit tricky when I tried to expense it at the company .
Would you spend your remaining money on replacing it ?
That &apos;s okay , because you learned a new skill today .
We all know the arguments that being vegetarian is better for the environment and for the animals -- but in a carnivorous culture , it can be hard to make the change . Graham Hill has a powerful , pragmatic suggestion : Be a weekday veg .
We will be able to look at income distributions in completely new ways .
Thank you .
Thank you very much .
And instead of using ink , we use -- you just saw an inkjet cartridge -- we just use cells .
But first , compassion is comprised of that capacity to see clearly into the nature of suffering .
So there &apos;s been plenty of people , plenty of us have been quietly arguing that we should have this independent system for years , but it &apos;s very hard to get people focused on plan B when plan A seems to be working so well .
Very simple .
We have an enormous disparity in the world .
Well , these objections were perfectly reasonable a few years ago , but things have changed .
This is a research which was done in &apos; 86 , but it &apos;s still valid .
Now , these are bottlenose dolphins , and you &apos;ll see them starting to synchronize their behavior and their sounds .
Less than a week later , though , I received a little bit of grace .
So , these are the problems .
So there &apos;s more . There &apos;s more .
These carriers of the weak force , the Zs , the same .
OK . Good .
And I know that &apos;s going to come as a shock to some of you , but you are .
And in fact , it &apos;s grown all over the world -- yucca , tapioca , manioc , cassava , it &apos;s all the same thing -- a very starchy root vegetable .
So they really were working under tough conditions .
You know the feedback , whether you &apos;re solving the puzzles or not .
But sometimes he wasn &apos;t sure whether he was hallucinating or not , because the hallucinations would fit in the context of the visions .
Thank you .
Now , young dolphins learn a lot as they &apos;re growing up , and they use their teenage years to practice social skills , and at about the age of nine , the females become sexually mature , so they can get pregnant , and the males mature quite a bit later , at around 15 years of age .
We had one of those commuter marriages .
Palestine is something of a cartographic anomaly because it &apos;s two parts Palestinian , one part Israel .
The restaurants here -- the apartments and the theater , etc .
And everybody disappeared from the street .
And the rule was , because I was sensitive , I was compassionate , I was very sensitive to injustice , and I was very pro-justice .
The lowest amount we ever got was 20 cents .
This is the background noise of industrial design .
What they were doing was returning the favor , by giving us a hypothesis to test , in biology , that we wouldn &apos;t have thought of .
In fact I did not know what African authenticity was .
The fact is , you can do it all with one towel .
It &apos;s something which has spread incredibly fast .
But -- Tell me about what -- I mean , I think you asked the board what you might say at TED , right ?
They &apos;ll follow up with you , and we &apos;ll take care of it . &quot;
I &apos;d like to talk about some other technologies out there , just technologies on our radar -- and I &apos;ll use this lens , these four , as a way to kind of tell you where each one of those technologies is in its development .
Terrific . You learn everything you can about that .
We have seen that here today with the sense , with the sensitivity -- and in the last three days , and with the power of the indomitable human spirit .
The World Health Organization puts the number of Chernobyl-related deaths at 4,000 , eventually .
They power how a cell replicates . They power our hearts .
Some of the guys used to very heavy jobs said , &quot; I don &apos;t want to be a victim .
Antarctica , if you include the ice shelves , is twice the size of Australia -- it &apos;s a big place .
My husband &apos;s like , &quot; Honey , deception ?
So we go back and we do that again , and again .
I want you to make as many new words as possible .
And a year before that I was a pack-a-day smoker , living a very sedentary lifestyle .
The people who make shoes go to sleep , wake up in the morning , and all the shoes are magically made for them .
Oh , I really am worried . Wow , there &apos;s so much anxiety . &quot;
And I thought a lot about , What was my daughter &apos;s life going to be like without me ?
I picked two well-known examples , because they &apos;re very well-known for expressing science through art .
Solving the world &apos;s problems can be done , if you really put your mind to it and use clean , renewable energy .
Bruno Bowden + Rufus Cappadocia : Blindfold origami and cello
I tried to figure out -- maybe solar &apos;s become attractive .
Likewise , with solar , especially here in California , we &apos;re discovering that the 80 solar farm schemes that are going forward want to basically bulldoze 1,000 square miles of southern California desert .
Instead , I began to write about people other than me and things that never really happened .
And at a time of economic collapse when people sold baby dolls and shoe laces and windows and doors just to survive , these girls made the difference between survival and starvation for so many .
That &apos;s what the surgeon is saying in the operating room when the patient &apos;s on the table .
Another major impediment to the flow of remittances reaching the family is the large and exorbitant and illegal cost of recruitment , fees that migrants pay , migrant workers pay to laborers who found them the job .
These are a species that we need to join with .
I , like many of you , live somewhere between reality and video games .
And what you find is when you do something fun , it has a square wave walk set .
You show me your search history , and I &apos;ll find something incriminating or something embarrassing there in five minutes .
Now , some people look at this and talk about shallow materialism , but that &apos;s absolutely the wrong way to look at it .
There are some reckless people , but it &apos;s not worth it , OK ?
How is it someone can go through the worst experience imaginable , and come home , back to their home , and their family , their country , and miss the war ?
And so there &apos;s a lot of -- I &apos;m sure you &apos;ve read a lot in papers , about worries about cyberattacks and defenses against those .
In Biosphere 2 I totally understood that I had a huge impact on my biosphere , everyday , and it had an impact on me , very viscerally , very literally .
Racing with the machine beats racing against the machine .
And then , I did another experiment , and I got people off the street to use the robotic desk lamp , and try out this idea of embodied artificial intelligence .
Give them 18 white pills and six blue ones and tell them to take the white pills first and then take the blue ones .
His son asked him for some lemonade and Dad went to the concession stand to buy it .
I know that we have systematically annihilated the girl cell .
So it can be very dim over there , and you do your work , and it can be very bright over there , and you do your work .
Shawn Achor : The happy secret to better work
We &apos;ve got dedicated lanes that keep cars out because they get ticketed by a camera if they use that lane , and it &apos;s been a huge success .
You put water into a bottle , it becomes the bottle .
Wind takes about two to five years on average , same as concentrated solar and photovoltaics .
It isn &apos;t as bad as it might seem .
Now the way that plants transmit that information is through pollen .
There was no way for me to do it .
Bassam Tariq : The beauty and diversity of Muslim life
I was taking some part of the objects , or any of the intuitiveness of real life , and bringing them to the digital world , because the goal was to make our computing interfaces more intuitive .
So that could be a problem .
You don &apos;t work in your self-interest all the time , because when emotion comes into it , the wiring changes in the way it functions .
My publishers cut out the question mark . The American publishers changed our title to &quot; Our Final Hour . &quot;
In that headset you have fabric sensors on your forehead and above the ear .
Now it &apos;s 0.5 -- even worse than that in America -- showing us the income inequality .
It lost 80 percent of its ice .
But they had hustled to feed their kids and pay their rent .
Before I can do that I &apos;ve got to tell you about sliced bread , and a guy named Otto Rohwedder .
Thank you .
Choice . Now you all shop online , compare online , do everything online , and yet this revolution has hardly touched the surface of public services like education , or health care or policing , and you &apos;re going to see this change massively .
Could art change the world ?
Now one brain region that would be robustly active in particular is called the hippocampus , which for decades has been implicated in processing the kinds of memories that we hold near and dear , which also makes it an ideal target to go into and to try and find and maybe reactivate a memory .
It wasn &apos;t all bad .
I made hundreds of them for the last 75 years .
And we then call that schizophrenia .
I discovered an invasive species in my own backyard .
If we manage to do that , forget the molecular detail .
Are they so different ?
So all of that being said , I still really appreciate those characters in movies and articles like that on our site , that aren &apos;t just about being totally powerful , maybe finding your acceptance with yourself and self-esteem and your flaws and how you accept those .
In every single case , the answer is &quot; it depends . &quot;
Not really .
It starts with a plan .
Tiny tweaks can lead to big changes .
This is a jump I did in Rio de Janeiro .
It &apos;s caused by fast processing of toxic cassava root in famine situation .
It was , for me , one of the most difficult things I &apos;d ever done , but it was also the most beautiful .
But now we do .
Now , if you think about how we deal with energy pricing , for instance , we consider emissions taxes , which means we &apos;re imposing the costs of pollution on people who actually use that energy .
Many , many steps were taken to pull this off .
We changed our logo , for the day , from the alien to a Splashy , to sort of help the cause .
One sees maybe just the right number of patterns to win a Nobel Prize .
This certainly is an accomplishment that must never be surpassed .
The way I suspect it will happen is using artificial chromosomes and extra chromosomes , so we go from 46 to 47 or 48 .
So they all trained .
And what month ? June .
So we look at these sorts of things theoretically , on the basis of genetics , and brain damage , and interaction with environment , and exactly how that machine works .
And so , effectively until the rise of the coffeehouse , you had an entire population that was effectively drunk all day .
And technology has set us free -- this is free WiFi .
Books kind of saved me in the last couple years , and that &apos;s a gift that I would like to pass on .
And someone asked , &quot; Why ? &quot;
Okay , we &apos;ll do something with it .
Let &apos;s go for hip replacement . &quot;
So with the help of some biologists studying the fungus , I got some maps and some GPS coordinates and chartered a plane and started looking for the death rings , the circular patterns in which the fungus kills the trees .
I mean , obviously , it &apos;s got some very offensive , obscene content on it , just in terms of language alone .
Electronics kits are very powerful in that they teach us how things work , but the constraints inherent in their design influence the way we learn .
There was tuna salad sandwiches and egg salad sandwiches and salmon salad sandwiches .
Lunch ladies treat me really well .
I could decide that I &apos;m hungry but know that it &apos;s not a great time to eat .
Let &apos;s do this . Thank you .
And the answer to what would I do if I wasn &apos;t afraid is I would get on the TED stage , and talk about women , and leadership . And I did , and survived . PM : I would say , not only survived . I &apos;m thinking of that moment , Sheryl , when you and I were standing backstage together , and you turned to me , and you told me a story .
Most of the time , we don &apos;t have any kind of internal cue to let us know that we &apos;re wrong about something , until it &apos;s too late .

Well there really is no brain trust .
Charlie Todd causes bizarre , hilarious , and unexpected public scenes : Seventy synchronized dancers in storefront windows , &quot; ghostbusters &quot; running through the New York Public Library , and the annual no-pants subway ride . In his talk , he shows how his group , Improv Everywhere , uses these scenes to bring people together . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
The reasons why we &apos;re so successful are because of three things .
Finally , at the end of use , we could biodegrade it naturally along with your vegetable peelings .
So this is not the first time NRK had been on board a ship .
Many different parts .
Nirvana . I found Nirvana . And I remember thinking , there &apos;s no way I would ever be able to squeeze the enormousness of myself back inside this tiny little body .
And I went , &quot; Oh my God .
Attention is time .
The International Cat Video Film Festival didn &apos;t have that much of a reaction .
And so my request is , please , let &apos;s make technologies that make people more human , and not less .
So , I have a question . When you start talking about using magnetic pulses to change people &apos;s moral judgments , that sounds alarming .
She lives with her parents , her two brothers and her great-aunt .
And the second question to that then is , ensure you &apos;ve explained how it is that planes can fly upside down .
Because we &apos;re far from home , we &apos;re very tired . &quot;
Yes , of course , it &apos;s a cow .
And now I &apos;m not swimming with a nice long stroke , I &apos;m sort of crabbing it this way .
Another example of this sort of second superpower thing is the rise of these games that are what we call &quot; serious play . &quot;
What it means to put it mathematically is that , if you &apos;re concerned about a society today , you should be looking not at the value of the mathematical function -- the wealth itself -- but you should be looking at the first derivative and the second derivatives of the function . That &apos;s one general theme . A second general theme is that there are many , often subtle environmental factors that make some societies more fragile than others . Many of those factors are not well understood . For example , why is it that in the Pacific , of those hundreds of Pacific islands , why did Easter Island end up as the most devastating case of complete deforestation ?
So cyber weapons are dangerous by nature , but in addition , they &apos;re emerging in a much more unstable environment .
And this slide here is the best simplification of the Great Divergence story I can offer you .
I &apos;m , among several other things , an electrical engineer , and that means that I spend a good amount of time designing and building new pieces of technology , and more specifically designing and building electronics .
It &apos;s the final emancipation of the city from any apparent relationship with nature at all .
And she said , &quot; What &apos;s the struggle ? &quot;
Before we do that , I want to kind of put biology in its place .
And went from swimming one lap -- so 20 yards -- like a drowning monkey , at about 200 beats per minute heart rate -- I measured it -- to going to Montauk on Long Island , close to where I grew up , and jumping into the ocean and swimming one kilometer in open water , getting out and feeling better than when I went in .
They produced an election forum booklet for the entire town to learn more about their candidates .
And in that space station we have the genetic material , the chromosomes , within a nucleus .
I can &apos;t believe they did all those things and didn &apos;t also have a modern language .
And I was five years old , and I never understood why NASA didn &apos;t hire Captain Kirk and Spock to do the job ; after all , they were very proficient -- but just seeing that as a kid made me believe , as my grandmother used to tell me , that &quot; impossible is just the possible that someone has not put in enough effort to make it come true . &quot;
I &apos;m a psychologists -- why do origins matter so much ?
We &apos;re beginning to see the emergence of wonderful technologies like real-time energy meters .
You ate food .
That &apos;s the one advantage that older people have .
Let universality make way for plurality .
Theo Jansen : I want to put these forms of life on the beaches .
But , some researchers , myself included -- some NGOs and some people from the Brazilian government -- believe there is an alternative .
So we tried to look at all the different heat engines that have been used in history to try and convert sunlight to electricity , or heat to electricity .
Investors get two opportunities : for the first time , they can invest in social change .
And what it means is we really are Bayesian inference machines .
Obviously , this kind of thing became popular .
The Brazil Ornithological Society -- so now we &apos;re talking only birds -- claims that we have too little knowledge about the species in nature .
So that &apos;s where I want to begin my little exploration , is in life .
By the way , I must admit , my English is not so good , I didn &apos;t know what is scrotal ; I understand it &apos;s a scrotum .
In a book that I &apos;m currently working on , I hope to use language to shed light on a number of aspects of human nature , including the cognitive machinery with which humans conceptualize the world and the relationship types that govern human interaction .
We make a new car every year , and then we spend the rest of the season trying to understand what it is we &apos;ve built to make it better , to make it faster .
And we do this every time that a video is uploaded to YouTube .
It came from about 300 years ago , and it came from the last and the biggest of the empires on this planet . &#91; &quot; The British Empire &quot; &#93; Imagine trying to run the show , trying to run the entire planet , without computers , without telephones , with data handwritten on pieces of paper , and traveling by ships .
But if you want to look for effective charities , this is a good website to go to .
It was deemed to be an unpredictable event .
And so if you think about what that means , it means a lot more than just building a cool website .
This may actually be heresy to say this at TED , but I &apos;d like to introduce you to the most important innovation , I think , in medicine to come in the next 10 years , and that is the power of the human hand -- to touch , to comfort , to diagnose and to bring about treatment .
Here &apos;s my cousin Gwyneth Paltrow .
Sometimes I think back to that night in the E.R.
One day it was normal ; the next day it was hell .
One of those businesses was a computer rental business called Micros on the Move , which is very well named , because people kept stealing the computers .
He actually moved across the street from us , and he held a cocktail party to meet the neighbors , and he says , &quot; You &apos;re Don Tapscott .
I mix them together , add a little bit of salt water , and then add this long strand I was telling you about , that I &apos;ve stolen from a virus . And then what happens is , you heat this whole thing up to about boiling . You cool it down to room temperature , and as you do , what happens is those short strands , they do the following thing : each one of them binds that long strand in one place , and then has a second half that binds that long strand in a distant place , and brings those two parts of the long strand close together so that they stick together .
So we all make a mad dash to that bookshelf , because we feel like if we aren &apos;t trying everything , it &apos;s as if we &apos;re doing nothing and we &apos;re defaulting on our obligations to our kids .
And that is seductive .
And it was going to be a look at life through the kitchen .
And so , texting is very loose in its structure .
Children , most of them , became very malnourished , like this .
As the poet Terence , the Roman poet once said , he said , &quot; The less my hope , the hotter my love . &quot;
And this is an aerial view of a recreation of one of my projects that was used in the movie .
Just take the Balkans . Croatia , Serbia Bosnia , they &apos;re not members of the E.U. yet .
And so there &apos;s nothing in the software that enforces the rules .
Plastics are a whole other story : well less than 10 percent are recovered .
We also believe this cancer might be very old .
Thank you .
And this is why things don &apos;t get done at work -- it &apos;s because of the M &amp; amp ; Ms.
These are subjects coming to an experiment to be asked the simplest of all questions : How much will you enjoy eating potato chips one minute from now ?
He was a new man , taller again .
Halfway up the bank , a young teenage elephant came in behind her , and he propped his trunk underneath her , and he began to shovel her up the bank .
Once you take this , there &apos;s no reason to restrict innovation , the beneficiaries of innovation , just to end users .
This is the stuff that &apos;s exhilarating and interesting .

So finally that brings us to one more idea : If scientists judge evidence collectively , this has led historians to focus on the question of consensus , and to say that at the end of the day , what science is , what scientific knowledge is , is the consensus of the scientific experts who through this process of organized scrutiny , collective scrutiny , have judged the evidence and come to a conclusion about it , either yea or nay .
But in our experience , we actually stand a chance of making it work .
I hope that that after this talk you &apos;ll be doing that .

The failure points were the same : walls and slabs not tied properly into columns -- that &apos;s a roof slab hanging off the building -- cantilevered structures , or structures that were asymmetric , that shook violently and came down , poor building materials , not enough concrete , not enough compression in the blocks , rebar that was smooth , rebar that was exposed to the weather and had rusted away .
But I &apos;d like to make the case to you in the next 17 minutes that when we shortcut the physical exam , when we lean towards ordering tests instead of talking to and examining the patient , we not only overlook simple diagnoses that can be diagnosed at a treatable , early stage , but we &apos;re losing much more than that .
Let &apos;s do something about it . &quot;
America cannot wait another 50 years to get this right .
We seem to have forgotten -- as though , with the explosion of knowledge , the whole human genome mapped out at our feet , we are lulled into inattention , forgetting that the ritual is cathartic to the physician , necessary for the patient -- forgetting that the ritual has meaning and a singular message to convey to the patient .

I used to think I would know myself to be mature when I could simply be gay without emphasis , but the self-loathing of that period left a void , and celebration needs to fill and overflow it , and even if I repay my private debt of melancholy , there &apos;s still an outer world of homophobia that it will take decades to address .
So this is how much people agree with the conclusions with no image .
And the Khan Academy videos are there .
What happens when you get an entire audience to stand up and connect with one another ? Chaos , that &apos;s what .

I think what they &apos;re excited about is they can now follow these kids .
But for us to get them , not only do we push ourselves , but we live by certain rules of engagement , which mean we can &apos;t interfere .

In 1991 , Shaka Senghor shot and killed a man . He was , he says , &quot; a drug dealer with a quick temper and a semi-automatic pistol . &quot; Jailed for second degree murder , that could very well have been the end of the story .

Others of them are very real , in a certain sense .

You probably had no idea . It &apos;s like driving around the world six times .
And they need advanced notice to do that .
Let &apos;s say that if the physics of fusion is encoded into the universe , maybe the physics of life is as well .
And because these mutations happen approximately as a function of time , you can transform these differences to estimates of time , where the two humans , typically , will share a common ancestor about half a million years ago , and with the chimpanzees , it will be in the order of five million years ago .
And then when you &apos;ve had your fill of that , you can click on one more link .

And within an hour and a half , I had 150 responses .
This actually forms a large part of our decision-making process .
And life is really , too .
It would have the informality of the town square .
We were wrong because we thought , naturally enough , in nation-state ways .
I &apos;m working with a young computer-animator documentarian named Nick Deamer , and this is a little demo that he &apos;s done for me , part of a larger project some of you may be interested in .
Now , with the gravity of this doomsday diagnosis , it just sucked me in immediately , as if I began preparing myself as a patient to die according to the schedule that they had just given to me , until I met a patient named Verna in a waiting room , who became a dear friend , and she grabbed me one day and took me off to the medical library and did a bunch of research on these diagnoses and these diseases , and said , &quot; Eric , these people who get this are normally in their &apos; 70s and &apos; 80s .
Or we can create very specific prosthetics for that individual .

Thirdly , when Norden was making his calculations , he assumed that a plane would be flying at a relatively slow speed at low altitudes .
And so that &apos;s the case of everyone joining in .
Here &apos;s another example , which I put up because it &apos;s an example of really important current science .
We &apos;ve suffered prosecution ; the paper was closed down more than three times .

Voice 5 : I was in Times Square . Voice 6 : São Paolo , Brazil .
We should all be riding one of these .
Now , along -- Derek and I met when he was four and a half years old , and at first , Derek , I thought you were mad , to be honest , because when you played the piano , you seemed to want to play every single note on the keyboard , and also you had this little habit of hitting me out of the way .

He once told me -- he looked kind of sad ; he worries very much about the haves and have-nots .
And this is a song that has a kind of a Celtic feel .
To address questions like that , scientists are now scanning other species of animals , and they &apos;re also scanning human infants .

We could not get enough of your cells to grow outside of your body .
Anywhere you go .
Now , let &apos;s compare this with the brain .

So , imagine you &apos;re looking at something like a cable supporting a traffic light .
The red represents the hot gas , and , of course , you can see many galaxies .
When I launched my wish last year , hundreds of people stood up and said they wanted to help us .

So what we did was , we took some of the money that we raised in Australia to bring the campaign across to this country , the U.S , and the U.K. , and we did that because we knew , if this was successful , we could raise infinitely more money globally than we could just in Australia . And that money fuels research , and that research will get us to a cure .
I talked a lot about JavaScript .
It &apos;s tough .
It will stop because of the growing demand of us on all the resources , all the capacity , all the systems of the Earth , which is now having economic damage .
