Thank God I was still in my hospital room and my doctors were right there .
Ancient monuments give us clues to astonishing past civilizations -- but they &apos;re under threat from pollution , war , neglect . Ben Kacyra , who invented a groundbreaking 3D scanning system , is using his invention to scan and preserve the world &apos;s heritage in archival detail .
You can go to Holy Name , which is coed , or St. John &apos;s , which is all boys .
It was in a grizzly bear preserve , although no one told me that before we went .
Another important aspect of this approach is the gathering and mining of data in the cloud , so we can get results in real time and analyze them with our contextual information .
If that &apos;s how you talked , imagine what kind of work would get done .
Imagine a weather station that can be attached to this .
We want to pretend that Mexico has the flu .
But claiming these spaces for public use was not simple , and it &apos;s even harder to keep them that way .
And it doesn &apos;t necessarily mean harmony and peace and quiet , but it does mean huge involvement in everybody else &apos;s affairs .
The idea is that instead of figuring out how to ameliorate symptoms with devices and drugs and the like -- and I &apos;ll come back to that theme a few times -- instead of doing that , we will regenerate lost function of the body by regenerating the function of organs and damaged tissue .
This is &quot; 6,500 Yards , &quot; after Corot . &quot; 9,000 Yards , &quot; after Gerhard Richter .
Now this , for me , is a common situation .
So the question becomes , how can we start to identify what exactly those genes are .
The flow isn &apos;t natural .
Amos Winter : And thank you very much for having me today .
And the problem is that a lot of people suck at drawing , and they get bummed out at this , sort of , you know , stick figure , awful little thing that they created .
We needed to step away from talking from government to army , from army to army , and we needed to talk about the universal values , and we needed to talk about humanity .
It naturally doesn &apos;t spill no matter what the quad does .
For instance , why would I make myself invisible ?
So for five minutes , nothing , and this is worse than being heckled .
But also , I &apos;m looking to see what is it that &apos;s shaping that person &apos;s ability to contribute , to do something beyond themselves . So maybe the real question is , you know , I look at life and say , there &apos;s two master lessons .
Are we raising kids who are obsessed with getting A &apos;s ?
And so , that &apos;s what we are trying to do .
A measure of music as a dollar .
We can start harvesting condensation , and start greening the desert from within .
But with new or better vaccines for malaria , TB , HIV , pneumonia , diarrhea , flu , we could end suffering that has been on the Earth since the beginning of time .
Well , part of the problem , surely , is people do not fully understand .
Can you picture the politicians ever buying into this ?
This is incredible .
Steve Wozniak invented the first Apple computer sitting alone in his cubical in Hewlett-Packard where he was working at the time .
They created a global computer made up of people .
So let &apos;s get started now .
It may seem that we &apos;re living in a borderless world where ideas , goods and people flow freely from nation to nation . We &apos;re not even close , says Pankaj Ghemawat . With great data , he argues that there &apos;s a delta between perception and reality in a world that &apos;s maybe not so hyperconnected after all .
So I &apos;ll just let this chair come down .
We can do it that way .
They attract people to learning because it &apos;s really a dance project or a circus project or , the best example of all -- El Sistema in Venezuela -- it &apos;s a music project .
So those are the kind of stakes that we &apos;re after .
And I believe we count as a threshold in this great story .
And we thought that it could be a thermoregulatory behavior .
John Hunter : I offered them a -- Actually , I can &apos;t tell them anything because I don &apos;t know the answer .
So it &apos;s a very interesting aspect of human sexuality .
There &apos;s some venture capital investments that were well-meaning and didn &apos;t go well .
And while that swim took place three years ago , I can remember it as if it was yesterday .
It &apos;s you talking to yourself . What do you do before you go into a job interview ? You do this .
And remember , it &apos;s frozen .
And when I see the power that dispersal has on these biogeographic patterns , it makes me think that it &apos;s possible to tackle really challenging problems , like hospital-acquired infections .
People collating information , pointing people to news sources , pointing people to the US geological survey .
We had never seen that before .
Ah , what a wonderful smell . &quot;
And see how the railing widens and flattens out so you can lay down your lunch or your laptop .
SR : And finally , what do we make of all this ?
And this is the Detroit airport in June 19th of 2002 .
So we &apos;re going to actually do a live exam to sort of see how Libby &apos;s doing .
And that is what I hope for us , and if this has contributed a little to making you want to do the same , stop , look , go .
So , suddenly you see a face . Suddenly you see a car .
If this technology is widely adopted , I will not benefit financially in any way , and that is very important to me , because it allows me to continue to tell you the truth .
I &apos;m not going to answer that . But I will answer some of the more popular questions .
When Muhammad told me his personal story , how his father , 55 years old , collapsed at home , had a cardiac arrest , and it took over an hour for an ambulance arrive , and he saw his father die in front of his eyes , he asked me , &quot; Please start this in east Jerusalem . &quot;
And in the last season there were two women in the finalists .
And it turns out Weiffenbach is kind of an expert in microwave reception , and he &apos;s got a little antennae set up with an amplifier in his office .
So the original vision was to have a keyboard hanging from the boat attached to a computer , and the divers and dolphins would activate the keys on the keypad and happily exchange information and request toys from each other .
Girl 3 : This is my pretend &#91; unclear &#93; one .
It &apos;s probably not the kind of music you would listen to cruising down the highway , but it &apos;s a foundation of computer-generated music , and using ChucK , we &apos;ve actually been building instruments in the Stanford Laptop Orchestra , based right here at Stanford Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics .
So , empathize , by all means , with the other person , but do not actually experience the touch , otherwise you &apos;ll get confused and muddled . &quot;
And everybody raised their hand .
So , what if you don &apos;t want to take your temperature every day ?
Correlation in itself doesn &apos;t prove causality .
When he received his award , he said these lovely words : &quot; The children can lead Africa from what it is today , a dark continent , to a light continent . &quot;
Because it &apos;s like as Bill Clinton was saying about Rwandan health clinics .
Well , we &apos;ve got about 120 people who have now taken this giving pledge .
They don &apos;t understand real world space .
And that &apos;s frightening . It &apos;s terrifying .
I think what we need to look at is we need to look at learning as the product of educational self-organization .
Let &apos;s start with mortgages .
The Netherlands is on the left . And Belgium is on the right .
Thank you .
Theirs may be bigger , but ours is better , and it could be better , for example , in that it seems larger than it should be , with a much larger cerebral cortex than we should have for the size of our bodies .
Here &apos;s what he had to say .
When we &apos;re on our deathbeds , will we regret the time we spent playing games ?
But again , the question is , here you saw them on a one-to-one basis -- the pest , the natural enemy .
There are millions and millions of sensors surrounding us today , but there &apos;s still so much we don &apos;t know on a daily basis .
And when you speak as much as I do , three or four times a day , you get rusty .
Is it a melody or a rhythm or a mood or an attitude ?
It &apos;s not steering , it &apos;s flight .
And in the presence of contempt , whether or not deception follows -- and it doesn &apos;t always follow -- look the other way , go the other direction , reconsider the deal , say , &quot; No thank you . I &apos;m not coming up for just one more nightcap . Thank you . &quot;
Molecules are competing for stuff .
Now this is very interesting because at the time everything was about competition and aggression , and so it wouldn &apos;t make any sense .
And very often violence is a way to cope with it .
And so instead , they have invaded financial and corporate crime in a big way , but above all , two sectors , and that is counterfeit goods and cybercrime .
We happened to win , just recently , the Green Product of the Year for &quot; The Re-Invention of Drywall , &quot; from Popular Science .
In fact , research has shown that the more the world is flat , if I use Tom Friedman &apos;s analogy , or global , the more and more people are wanting to be different .
Yes . Yeah , OK . I &apos;ll tell you what , Chris : as long as you have that book in front of you , do me a favor , turn to a year outside of the 1900s , either into the 1800s or way into the 2000s -- that &apos;ll be a much greater challenge for me .
And I &apos;m just going to take a picture of it , and I &apos;m just going to post it on Facebook with kind of &quot; Israelis for peace &quot; or something .
Sure enough , their tools were more complicated than those of Homo erectus , but they too showed very little change over the 300,000 years or so that those species , the Neanderthals , lived in Eurasia .
But when we fail to give our best , we simply haven &apos;t met the test , of giving all and saving none until the game is really won ; of showing what is meant by grit ; of playing through when others quit ; of playing through , not letting up .
What we are interested in is information .
There has to be a little side road off there for people who don &apos;t want to go on that track .
It took them six years to get 1,000 cars in service .
Play a sport with a friend at lunchtime .
I was a wimp .
We think this one thing is going to happen and something else happens instead .
And it &apos;s a center , a focal point for economic and social development .
And if one were to eclipse the Milky Way , this is what it would look like .
Rembrandt is a propagandist in the Christian view .
So once the patient steps onto the floor -- -- an alert is sent to the caregiver &apos;s smartphone .
It &apos;s called a carbon-oxygen dwarf .
It &apos;s a grand idea of design -- a huge idea of design , common to all of the voices of religion and philosophy that emerged in the Classical period .
And that was responsiveness .
And you know what ?
So the signal-to-noise ratio then presents us with a pattern-detection problem .
And it ends like this : &quot; This telegraph is a fantastic instrument to diffuse religion , civilization , liberty and law throughout the world . &quot;
I tweet . I love it .
We shopped double coupons and layaway and consignment stores , and when she got sick with stage four breast cancer and could no longer work , we even applied for food stamps .
And if girls are in trouble because they face systematic disadvantages that keep them where society wants them to be , including lack of access to healthcare , education , healthy foods , labor force participation .
This includes a large amount of human error .
So , we are not being charged with the adequate response to what is happening .
They give high endorsement of these sorts of statements all across the board , but as you also see , liberals care about it a little more than conservatives -- the line slopes down .
No , there have been any number of people saying this over the last seven years .
The only machine capable to capture the carbon that we are producing , always , even if we reduce them , everything that we do , we produce CO2 , are the trees .
One hundred twenty-five girls will not be married when they &apos;re 12 years old .
He prays before he eats .
So I did the thing .
So I didn &apos;t always make my living from music .
What did we find when we called them back at the end of the day ?
It was a television show -- it was a NOVA show on PBS -- about caves in New Mexico .
They are so many and so varied that from this distance they appear like the stars from Earth .
In the summer of 2009 , my dad was diagnosed with lung cancer .
It was a game of hunting questions like this .
And my country relies on its security through military alliance , that &apos;s clear .
Because your pay goes up and you vest into your pension .
So the conditions for success here are listed .
It &apos;s 14 hours of birdwatching on a TV screen , actually 87 days on the web .
For instance , this is Herbert with his grandmother .
One typical thing that happens is people will come from the highlands , where there are not many coconut trees , down to visit their relatives on the coast , where there are lots .
And I went back home and I said , &quot; Daddy , I don &apos;t know who I am .
We went from almost no Afghans having mobile telephones during the Taliban to a situation where , almost overnight , three million Afghans had mobile telephones .
So what &apos;s the problem ?
We know that modernization is happening .
Because they became my only friends , they became my friends , because very few people that I knew -- Well , I wasn &apos;t sent a lot of cards or flowers . I mean , if I had had a broken leg or I was with child I would have been inundated , but all I got was a couple phone calls telling me to perk up .
And so it &apos;s a very interesting phenomenon that &apos;s going across the world .
I just put a can on a copier and kept enlarging it until I got the size I want .
And as a result of that , we decided to do something that would help , first of all , the group at the bottom , African-American students , and then Hispanic students .
And what I &apos;m going to do is , I &apos;m going to hold it here , and I &apos;m going to spin it .
&quot; It has multiple functions . &quot;
Or ears being able to hear themselves -- it &apos;s just impossible .
One the one hand , I have a husband who &apos;s annoyingly lean and incredibly handsome .
Then one day , a man came to town with boxes and boxes of secret documents stolen from the parents &apos; rooms .
They started telling the West , &quot; Be aware of Al-Qaeda .
Now this is probably a good thing , right ?
We have to start changing this .
But if crony capitalism is , intellectually at least , the easy part of the problem , things get trickier when you look at the economic drivers of surging income inequality .
I realize that &apos;s an ambiguous statement .
And I think it really summarizes where we are here .
We know that about 106 billion people have ever lived .
Keyloggers silently sit on your computer , hidden from view , and they record everything you type .
Our prisons are getting safer for both staff and inmates , and when our prisons are safe , we can put our energies into a lot more than just controlling .
Now can it be right to reject a student on linguistic ability alone ?
And I consider these two elements to be vital human expressions .
They engineered a system that was so robust that it &apos;s still with us today , continuously producing identical people for a machine that no longer exists .
My TED wish . There &apos;s a vital story that needs to be told and I wish for TED to help me gain access to it and then to help me come up with innovative and exciting ways to use news photography in the digital era .
This was actually the experiment . So you can see the coils were somewhat larger .
I &apos;ve never seen a representation of a kind of radio interference patterns , which are so ubiquitous and such an important part of our lives .
So my favorite example is from this study that was published this year in the Proceedings of the National Academies .
It &apos;s an expedition of some 30 people .
Or are you going to go with a black version , which will allow you to create really bad TEDTalks , mostly about blogs , politics and stuff ?
It &apos;s not too difficult to do that .
Anil Ananthaswamy : What it takes to do extreme astrophysics
We want killer arguments .
Right ?
Most of them don &apos;t want to go back to the countryside , but they don &apos;t have the sense of belonging .
We are always trying to decode our world .
Low-cost providers around the world can do it cheaper .
And in France , there is a startup calle Compte Nickel , which is revolutionizing the banking sector .
The aggregates of joy and suffering thousands of confident religions , ideologies and economic doctrines , every hunter and forager , every hero and coward , every creator and destroyer of civilization , every king and peasant , every young couple in love , every mother and father , hopeful child , inventor and explorer , every teacher of morals , every corrupt politician , every superstar , every supreme leader , every saint and sinner in the history of our species , lived there , on a mote of dust , suspended in a sunbeam .
Where do we go from here ? How do we carry on ? I can &apos;t get beyond the questions Clambering for the scraps in the shatter of us , collapsed It cuts me with every could have been Pain on pain on play , repeating With the backup , makeshift life in waiting Everybody says time heals everything What of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? There is nothing to see here now Turning the sign around We &apos;re closed to the Earth &apos; til further notice A crumbling cliche case crumpled and puffy faced caught dead in the stare of a thousand miles All I want , only one street level miracle I &apos;ll be an out and out born again from none more cynical Everybody says that time heals everything But what of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? And sit here cold ? We will be long gone by then In lackluster In dust we lay around old magazines Fluorescent lighting sets the scene for all we could and should be being in the one life that we &apos;ve got Everybody says time heals everything And what of the wretched hollow ? The endless in between ? Are we just going to wait it out ? Just going to sweat it out ? Just going to sweat it out ? Wait it out
We can do what we need to do , but it will take every entrepreneur , every artist , every scientist , every communicator , every mother , every father , every child , every one of us .
And that goat was $ 120 .
Let &apos;s take a look at it again . Watch the coloration : white on the right , brown on the left .
I mean , this is perhaps a representative example of the visual depiction of the female form in the 15th century ; here is a representative example of the depiction of the female form in the 20th century .
We &apos;re able to draw upon specialization and exchange to raise each other &apos;s living standards .
The latest I &apos;ve read , seen , thought is that it &apos;s incredibly hard for them to do that .
And it has been shown actually outside of the U.S.
For the first time , I filmed on hidden camera the guys who do this , and they were ready to buy the arm and they were ready to use it to prepare those potions for people .
And what the hell does that mean to you ?
It &apos;s not climate , largely , which has got rid of the world &apos;s megafaunas .
Sometime during the Progressive Era , we put an end to this arrangement .
We all have had time .
Essentially , I &apos;m a mustache farmer .
It &apos;s also very biologically active , as anyone with hay fever will understand .
And , in fact , emotional contagion can be broader still .
He went in to check on her for school , and he got very excited .
And what was really most exciting -- and I think Richard Wurman discovered this at least 20 years before I did -- was that all this stuff is connected .
But history shows us that even as recently as our fathers &apos; and grandfathers &apos; day , there have been times of greater pragmatism , and tolerance , and a willingness to consider other interpretations : be it abortion , or masturbation , or even the incendiary topic of homosexuality .
But people did not relate to this .

There is the color red and the color black , representing the constant change from day to night .
And what &apos;s really happened over the period of time that I &apos;ve been working in intensive care is that the people whose lives we started saving back in the &apos; 70s , &apos; 80s , and &apos; 90s , are now coming to die in the 21st century of diseases that we no longer have the answers to in quite the way we did then .
This is the phrase that I &apos;ve used in some stuff which I &apos;ve done with a think tank in London called Demos , where we &apos;ve been looking at these people who are amateurs -- i.e. , they do it for the love of it -- but they want to do it to very high standards .
And I think it &apos;s wonderful that we do .
In addition , we are in the middle of the forest region of the country , and our public space sucks .
When we look back through history at all those who have sought an elixir in the past , the one thing they now have in common is that they &apos;re all dead .
For the past five years , I &apos;ve been researching , working with biologists and traveling all over the world to find continuously living organisms that are 2,000 years old and older .
That &apos;s what makes you hold it in and hide it .
It turns out it depends on what kind of sweatshirt they &apos;re wearing .
You just record the information , then you call it up and play it back when you want to answer questions or identify images .
And I &apos;ve been thinking a lot about what I have learned over these last particularly 11 years with V-Day and &quot; The Vagina Monologues , &quot; traveling the world , essentially meeting with women and girls across the planet to stop violence against women .
The general hospital right next door emerged largely unscathed .
They drink this fabulous nectar and then they &apos;re all a bit sticky .
So this is the 50 percent line that &apos;s the random expectation .
In other words , I can trust him or her .
and so how did you handle that ?
Christ , the Chinese even invented golf .
And today , if you go to the supermarket , a really good one , and you look at how many Ragus there are -- do you know how many they are ? 36 !
Okay , I &apos;m not the only one whistling here .
This is what happens when you take away 20 percent of the cars from the streets .
And sometimes I can leave .
Please keep your seat .
And I asked them to do a project together , tackle the issues affecting their country in cartoons , yes , in cartoons .
Thank you very much .
One of the key qualities of all stories is that they &apos;re made to be shared .
None of the work is my work . It &apos;s all work that my colleagues have done , and I actually asked them for their slides and incorporated them into this talk .
And the way she died -- she had , toward the end , a brain tumor .
So my talk had some of my four in the morning examples , but it also had examples from my fellow TED speakers that year .
In 2009 , we &apos;re down to 1,600 cases .
Because using ammonia you get hugely high pressures if you heated them wrong .
He &apos;s invited all the best people .
And this is deep inside of the brain . It &apos;s very old , evolutionarily .
One answer lies deep in our cultural history .
Well , Philip Anderson may have been right .
Interpreter : So I tried to disappear into JR &apos;s eye , but the problem is JR uses only models with big eyes .
Now , there &apos;s 40 scientists working on this project , and people are doing all kinds of really complicated and expensive analyses .
When we were talking on the phone , one of the things you said that really astonished me was you said one thing you were passionate about was server farms . Tell me about that .
Sometimes we even have these formalized cultural expectations .
And this is the best-studied sound , because it &apos;s easy to measure , really , and you &apos;d find this whistle when mothers and calves are reuniting , for example .
And how you end up with a psychopath , and a killer , depends on exactly when the damage occurs .
So if the only thing they &apos;d have to do after lunch is go to class , believe me , they &apos;re going to sit there and eat their lunch .
And light and shadow are a very important part of her work .
But that &apos;s okay .
So forget about retirements if you &apos;re young .
We can help them thrive .
This issue is , how will we react ?
Sometimes you come across a piece of content that is so compelling , you want to use it , you &apos;re dying to use it , but you &apos;re not 100 percent sure if you can because you don &apos;t know if the source is credible .
It has lower taxes .
And I don &apos;t know , I think this project has a lot of possibilities , and I encourage you all to record just a small snippet of your life every day , so you can never forget that that day , you lived .
I was studying the engineering , the psychology , the philosophy of teamwork .
After that first injury , their risk for second injury is exponentially greater .
So that &apos;s one out of every two or three people you know .
To say that we faced high doses of skepticism in those early years is just a huge understatement , but we were so convinced that we might be able to make this work that we chipped away with incremental modifications to this system .
Our journey did not , in fact , begin at Hercules Inlet , where frozen ocean meets the land of Antarctica .
And you &apos;ve all got an idea in your head of the answer .
But I , yeah , I think there &apos;s an opportunity . As the strike continues , there &apos;s an opportunity for more people to experience video on places like MySpace TV .
So we can &apos;t wait to get you all robots , and we can &apos;t wait to see what you build .
So why is that ? Why do cars work so well ?
I was actually really excited .
What are the challenges in getting value for money as well as value for many ?
Yeah , this is a fact that from where the money comes , they have been saving , you know , over the last decade .
But this is the end result .
So what is the intuitive , but incorrect assumption , that &apos;s kept us from understanding brains ?
And the evaluators have been trained to give you discouraging , non-verbal feedback like this .
And the problem of building it -- when the Balinese workers saw long reams of plans , they looked at them and said , &quot; What &apos;s this ? &quot;
This is where gut decisions come from .
And do you realize that almost all of those are due to human error and not machine error , and can therefore be prevented by machines ?
And we managed to get that magic moment .
I think those are deforming effects , and worst of all , it seems to prevent things like negotiation or deliberation or compromise or collaboration .
I thought that was a really , really nice example .
But we have a very pessimistic approach about the cities .
Here &apos;s what they do .
And this process goes on and on and on .
And that &apos;s what I wanted from them more than anything else .
My dad actually resigned from the male-only business club in my hometown because he said he would never be part of an organization that would one day welcome his son , but not his daughter .
And if you look at a guy called Dennis , when he decides what to become -- is it a lawyer , or does he want to become a doctor or a teacher ? -- best chance is that he wants to become a dentist .
People have been coming up to me ever since to ask me questions about spaghetti sauce , which is a wonderful thing in the short term -- but it &apos;s proven to be less than ideal over seven years .
And these two young farmers , they are girls now -- because the parents are dead from HIV and AIDS -- they discuss with a trained agronomist .
And any of you , for free , can go to that website and take the entire panoply of tests of happiness .
One of my favorite examples is that of Sir Harold Ridley , who was a famous ophthalmologist , or at least became a famous ophthalmologist .
Now having seen that -- and I &apos;ve seen it hundreds of times , because I use this in every talk I give -- I still can &apos;t see that they &apos;re the same size and shape , and I doubt that you can either .
And Darwin kept these copious notebooks where he wrote down every little idea he had , every little hunch .
And so all of these proteins can get basically recycled and used all over again .
I called that project Women Are Heroes .
They &apos;re fully functional , field-tested , ready to roll out .
If we can somehow encourage these molecules to talk to each other and make the right shapes and compete , they will start to form cells that will replicate and compete .
What are the obvious cues that this animal could use to direct its movement ? And the most obvious one is to look at the sky , and so we thought , now what could they be looking at in the sky ?
I love the little smile she does right over the top of the note -- like , &quot; No problem , everything &apos;s fine . &quot;
And then we can digitally remove the forest and see what &apos;s going on below the canopy .
English is the world &apos;s second language .
She &apos;s 50 years old . And she &apos;s looking as young as ever .
Nothing worked until I found this .
Here are some things we can do .
So I want you to think back a few months ago .
I began to see my body like an iPad or a car .
Obvious , right .
The patients learn to do this themselves And then the patients can undergo all the activities of their daily life .
Because it worked .
We can meaningfully put a dent in poverty .
And we can only create these out of darkness .
And things go white as we move out onto the Arctic Ocean .
If it is an adaptation , then we evolved to be religious .
This is a portrait of my daughter and myself .
I &apos;m working hard , lots of therapy -- speech therapy , physical therapy , and yoga too .
Then some people had a much harder policy , and this was very similar to the CMU policy , that it had to have eight characters including uppercase , lowercase , digit , symbol , and pass a dictionary check .
Patricia Kuhl : The linguistic genius of babies
You &apos;re going to have to pardon the sound quality , in some cases , because again , these were hidden cameras .
From Malta , Madagascar , Thailand , Vietnam , Jordan , Egypt , Israel , as far north as Alaska and as far south as New Zealand .
Fish do not sit in seats .
I mean , I could tell you hundreds of them .
I presently , or currently , work with smart materials , and a smart thermo-bimetal .
We can &apos;t believe how prevalent lying is .
I said , &quot; No , I can &apos;t use my legs . &quot;
And that &apos;s called a ring agglutinate .
And three of the smartest people were Stan Ulam , Richard Feynman and John von Neumann .
And in my book , I went into that question as well .
So I went about my business : Paragon Space Development Corporation , a little firm I started with people while I was in the Biosphere , because I had nothing else to do .
That &apos;s the boot sector of an infected floppy , and if we take a closer look inside , we &apos;ll see that right there , it says , &quot; Welcome to the dungeon . &quot;
Because , you see , this is the reality .
But there &apos;s been a lot of debate in Tunisia about how to handle this kind of problem .
Have you ever thought about how to prevent them ? &quot;
And Chad says , &quot; Sure , like , we have this , like , salmon , that &apos;s , like , rolled in this , like , wasabi , like , crust .
They were self-confident and determined . And the key for me today , the key for you , is , they were future-focused rather than present-focused .
They &apos;re just the best , and I love them so much and I care about them more than anything else .
Over 10,000 physicists and engineers from 85 countries around the world have come together over several decades to build this machine .
Laura Snyder : The Philosophical Breakfast Club
The trailers themselves are actually hand-built .

Now , what does this mean for our politics , for our public services , for our government ?
Now don &apos;t get me wrong ; I am not against teaching English , all you English teachers out there .

Especially because the decision makers in the United States are frequently able to insulate themselves from consequences by living in gated compounds , by drinking bottled water and so on .

One such project is about a year and a half old .
I guess you can call it a low-fat factory .
So for instance , most of the birds in this picture are migratory birds .
You can &apos;t compare the effect of multimedia-tasking and the effect of playing action games . They have totally different effects on different aspects of cognition , perception and attention .

Last year at TED we aimed to try to clarify the overwhelming complexity and richness that we experience at the conference in a project called Big Viz .
It &apos;s an extraordinary thing .
Ethnographer Wade Davis explores hidden places in the wider world -- but in this powerful short talk he urges us to save a paradise in his backyard , Northern Canada . The Sacred Headwaters , remote and pristine , are under threat because they hide rich tar sands . With stunning photos , Davis asks a tough question : How can we balance society &apos;s need for fuels with the urge to protect such glorious wilderness ?
I &apos;ve never stepped there before .
It &apos;s a great honor to be here .
Now , you might say , &quot; These are decisions we don &apos;t care about . &quot;
&quot; Surely not . &quot;
So we get this .
In this case , a project we &apos;re doing with Siemens , we have sensors on all the furniture , all the infill , that understands where people are and what they &apos;re doing .
Why haven &apos;t we allowed innovation to happen ?
And these forces act on , attract , bodies that have an electrical charge .
Well , when I arrived in Peru , actually , I had no idea about what I would do there .
And it &apos;s very important to have political reforms , to have widely shared benefits of economic growth .
And she makes them so they could either be broken up into payments , or they could be like these , which are leaves that can be payments .
That very sentence already reveals the doom of destruction of happiness .
I &apos;m often asked , what surprises you about the book ?
In general , and maybe , again , it &apos;s because I &apos;m a tech entrepreneur , I look at things as platforms .
Let me give you a few numbers to place what &apos;s happening .
Girl 10 : Well , sometimes it gets annoying when your brothers and sisters , or brother or sister , when they copy you and you get your idea first and they take your idea and they do it themselves .
And , again , a EU standard-size , real person , so you get some sense of the scale .
And then , what I &apos;m saying is , is that the eternal prediction is the output in the neocortex .
When I first saw her , I thought she would be dead in a matter of days .
But with synthetic biology , we can actually imagine engineering this bacterium to produce something that gives us the quality , quantity and shape of material that we desire .
But I think this is quite clearly untrue .
That &apos;s nine and a half thousand kilometers . We never thought that happened .
Two billion people without sanitation .
You probably think , well , I don &apos;t know which one you think it is , but I think it &apos;s about feeling beauty .
You &apos;ve got a plane that &apos;s thousands of feet up in the air , going at hundreds of miles an hour , and you &apos;re trying to drop an object , a bomb , towards some stationary target in the face of all kinds of winds and cloud cover and all kinds of other impediments .
Foremost among them is the exorbitant cost of sending money home .
My family had moved from Fort Lee , New Jersey to California , and we moved from the snow to lots of heat , and gas lines .
So we are doing our job .
And this actually shows that printing .
Let me show you the living mobile phone .
So , there is a lot of water below the surface .
And one of the things that you see is that male line , the mortality is going down , down , down , down , down .
They resisted environmental improvement .
Will these revolutions be whole like through the transitions to democracy or be overtaken by military or extremists of all kinds ? We cannot tell .
GG : The new one -- better , stronger , tougher .
But the main concern for the environmentally-interested students -- and they are right -- is about the future .
But under the pizza model , they &apos;re questions .
And you see , because of the speed , a sunrise or a sunset every 45 minutes for half a year .
I liked this one the best : a level 60 Warlock with lots of epics for 174,000 dollars .
It &apos;s produced by the malaria parasite and it &apos;s a very interesting crystalline substance .
So back to Homer .
The first couple of decades of their life in the North is quite well , up until about 1950 , which coincides with the city &apos;s peak population at 1.8 million people .
So many times , amateurs , not experts , have been the inventors and improvers of things ranging from mountain bikes to semiconductors , personal computers , airplanes .
So I can call it techno-crafted .
But it was , technically speaking -- this is an aside -- Prego is a better tomato sauce than Ragu .
One word of profanity , and you are out of here for the day .
They &apos;re soft , they &apos;re slimy , and I was fascinated by the way they use light in their environment , either to attract mates , for self-defense , or to attract food .
And where in the world would you find such water ?
You can program the hundreds of muscles in your arm .
And I wanted to show several species that we hadn &apos;t shown much in the magazine and worked in a number of locations .
I &apos;m from a completely different cultural area , maybe you noticed ?
It &apos;s difficult and stubborn .
But what does voluntary mean in a community where , when a girl gets raped , her father &apos;s first impulse , rather often , is to murder her out of shame ?
The Lego guys don &apos;t give you any royalties , strangely , but some user made this and then it sold .
You can &apos;t get rid of waste .
Seated in this audience are 996 small figures .
And from that , you can do things like reconstructing this extraordinary journey of that city that managed to have a sustainable development over a thousand years , managing to have all the time a form of equilibrium with its environment .
If I were to reduce this entire story into one image , what would it be ? &quot;
Exercises , drills , all over the world .
This whole notion of every man for himself is completely unsustainable .
So I stopped the car and I went to help .
I was in a doctor &apos;s office last CAT scan , and there was a Reader &apos;s Digest , October 2002 .
I hope I have achieved that .
Welcome to democracy , our Tunisian and Egyptian friends .
How about -- pick one Thursday once a month and cut that day in half and just say the afternoon -- I &apos;ll make it really easy for you .
So we did .
So my provocative statement is that we desperately need a serious scientific theory of cities .
I wanted to create a stack of books so that somebody could come into the gallery and think they &apos;re just looking at a regular stack of books , but then as they got closer they would see this rough hole carved into it , and wonder what was happening , wonder why , and think about the material of the book .
Girl 5 : No .
There is a film . You &apos;re seeing a film which has nothing to do with you , or that &apos;s how people think about it .
This is the USDA portion size , that little , tiny thing .
So there &apos;s some that are all about the toast , and all about the transformation of toast .
And , basically , none of them could solve it .
I admired them , and I decided to become a doctor .
It costs way less than obesity now .
And we think that might be because adolescents and adults use a different mental approach , a different cognitive strategy , to make social decisions , and one way of looking at that is to do behavioral studies whereby we bring people into the lab and we give them some kind of behavioral task , and I &apos;ll just give you another example of the kind of task that we use in my lab .
They don &apos;t know that she &apos;s dead .
And turned up the other way , the people who are retirement age goes up very , very fast , as the baby boomers get to retirement age .
Aristotle thought that practical wisdom was the key to happiness , and he was right .
These kinds of experiments , they filter into architectural models .
But what we &apos;re finding around the world , over and over again , is , if you build a toilet and you leave it there , it doesn &apos;t get used .
We &apos;re actually providing evidence for trials , like the genocide trial that happened last year in Guatemala where General Ríos Montt was found guilty of genocide and sentenced to 80 years .
These young ladies are living in a rice culture , but they know something that few people know in a rice culture .
They found something called Twitter .
And I wonder if that is really justice for them , to get their rights in that way .
It ignores the environment .
I also wanted to understand if we were making decisions in a way that made us safer .
How could you even write a rule that got the janitors to do what they did ?
I was optimizing my life for quality of life , and quality of life for me means time in snow .
I like this slide , because it &apos;s a chance to talk about what really motivates people to change , and what doesn &apos;t .
Diets don &apos;t have very much reliability .
AG : The answer to the question is hard for me because , on the one hand , I think that we should feel really great about the fact that the Republican nominee -- certain nominee -- John McCain , and both of the finalists for the Democratic nomination -- all three have a very different and forward-leaning position on the climate crisis . All three have offered leadership , and all three are very different from the approach taken by the current administration . And I think that all three have also been responsible in putting forward plans and proposals . But the campaign dialogue that -- as illustrated by the questions -- that was put together by the League of Conservation Voters , by the way , the analysis of all the questions -- and , by the way , the debates have all been sponsored by something that goes by the Orwellian label , &quot; Clean Coal . &quot; Has anybody noticed that ?
That &apos;s how we process information .
They &apos;re a cult all their own , blood brothers steeped in other people &apos;s blood .
And such skeptics can find comfort in the fourth kind of immortality story , and that is legacy , the idea that you can live on through the echo you leave in the world , like the great Greek warrior Achilles , who sacrificed his life fighting at Troy so that he might win immortal fame .
Well I &apos;m going to show you a group of makers from Maker Faire and various places .
We netted for breast cancer alone , that year alone , 71 million dollars after all expenses .
Some people think that swimming is a very solo sport , you just dive into the sea and off you go .
Now I &apos;m going to move on to another project I did .
I know Dr. Carolyn Porco is the camera P.I.
There &apos;s a raft of research , but I know it from my personal life .
Or an expensive watch , so you can impress people -- &quot; Oh gee , I didn &apos;t know you had that watch . &quot;
I mean , we &apos;re talking about an experience that of course can seem weird to many , but that is very educational .
It &apos;s fun . It &apos;s the most fun you can have with your pants on .
Now , by corruption I don &apos;t mean brown paper bag cash secreted among members of Congress .
And if you look at a galaxy even farther away , it would be moving away faster .
So this is the network of the ants that you just saw moving around in the arena , and it &apos;s this constantly shifting network that produces the behavior of the colony , like whether all the ants are hiding inside the nest , or how many are going out to forage .
Erinaceous : pertaining to the hedgehog family ; of the nature of a hedgehog .
And that &apos;s not exactly what I said , but -- the point is my role in the community -- within the free software world there &apos;s been a longstanding tradition of the &quot; benevolent dictator &quot; model .
We stopped planting clover and alfalfa , which are natural fertilizers that fix nitrogen in the soil , and instead we started using synthetic fertilizers .
That &apos;s the essence of the Abraham path .
We now have a more democratic view and way of making music -- a two-way street .
Say hello to EDI .
But it &apos;s not only about that .
And for us , in many ways , this elephant has become a symbol of inspiration for us , a symbol of that hope as we go forward in our work .
Then there is Kazakhstan , which didn &apos;t even have a name before .
Certainly we &apos;ve seen in recent years a lot of change in that regard , and people are starting to wake up about that .
And I was like , &quot; Why not magic pixie ? &quot;
So we have the perpetual adolescent .
And I saw this beautiful place . I knew I wanted to come back .
Egos , of course , again , a huge problem If you &apos;re working in a multidisciplinary team , you &apos;ve got to give your guys the benefit of the doubt .
I just took their pictures and pasted them .
Now go with me here . Look at this guy . You know who this is ?
You know , there was institutionalized , at one time legalized , discrimination in our country .
Thank you .
From Bon Iver playing with some friends in an apartment in Montmartre to Yeasayer having a long night , and many , many , many more unknown or very famous bands .
Others worshiped broccoli , as if it were God-like .
The next category is scattered fibroglandular densities , followed by heterogeneously dense and extremely dense .
But in this experiment we also hired an acting student .
And so , the parallel thing holds with technology , entertainment and design , I believe .
I bought a computer , and &#91; they &#93; told me it had millions of colors in it .
Thank you .
So we have the American dream look-alike , which is a mobile home .
They want to share the experience .
Can we be the surgeons of our classrooms ?
It &apos;s not just that gyre of plastic that I &apos;m concerned about -- it &apos;s the gyre of plastic in the supermarket .
SOPA is simply a reversion of COICA , which was purposed last year , which did not pass .
But I have changed my mind about stress , and today , I want to change yours .
But how about the kid on the left , or the athlete that leaves the field of play ?
We hired him full-time .
We blow it up and look at the pieces .
Thank you .
The first is that psychology should be just as concerned with human strength as it is with weakness .
So when you put the gel on , it actually reassembles into this local tissue .
So I think the future , main problem of psychology is to classify types of predicaments , types of situations , types of obstacles and also to classify available and possible ways to think and pair them up .
They started low , they skyrocketed , they peaked up there in 2003 , and now they are down .
But in the last 10 years , bandwidth has exploded a hundredfold .
Probably the best documented basking shark fishery in the world is that from Achill Island .
In this case , she picks up her phone , she can map food preparation at the kitchen island to a particular location of sunlight . An algorithm will keep it in that location as long as she &apos;s engaged in that activity .
Now , this is Bernoulli &apos;s gift . This is a direct quote .
And I want to share with you my latest art project .
The defeated candidate gave up power and made way for Ghana to move into a new democratic cycle .
And if we &apos;re so blessed , we engage in activities that transform suffering .
Maybe I can cut there , see the brain , and I can change my cut .
So depending on where it looks , it flips between the two possibilities .
We can use calculated randomness .
The filmmaker Mira Nair speaks about growing up in a small town in India . Its name is Bhubaneswar , and here &apos;s a picture of one of the temples in her town .
She does this with cardboard , but since I have an expensive computer here I &apos;ll just rotate this little guy around and ...
They &apos;ve discovered a new bond , a new material for transparent solar cells .
We give them a friendly face and a reassuring voice .
I &apos;m just simply saying that a world without love is a deadly place .
But the Age of Empires is gone .
Also , there &apos;s been this recent distrust of big brands , global big brands , in a bunch of different industries , and that &apos;s created an opening .
Then they had to bring them in .
This is how it looks pretty much every day .
Now , in fact , they couldn &apos;t do it for a lot of reasons today .
Forget nuclear holocaust ; it &apos;s the fork that we have to worry about .
When I first learned the statistics , I was pretty stunned at how bad things are .
He wouldn &apos;t have granted the cart , and he had a very interesting dissent .
And our idea is to make the seating carriage very sculptural and out of wood and like a big boat sitting in this plaster room .
I &apos;m just carving around whatever I find interesting .
And these nations are faced with a real problem .
One is treatment ; the other one is prevention .
And this is , in 2004 , the FDA has approved MR-guided focused ultrasounds for the treatment of symptomatic uterine fibroids .
What is happening is that , very rapidly in historical terms , the world is being driven and shaped , not by the old developed countries , but by the developing world .
We look at O.J. -- he &apos;s a good-looking guy .
It &apos;s one of many , many characteristics that women have that they will bring into the job market .
Elizabeth Murray surprised me with her admission about her earlier paintings .
Dictionaries are a wonderful guide and resource , but there is no objective dictionary authority out there that is the final arbiter about what words mean .
It &apos;s thousands of times , maybe 3,000 times tougher than this .
Organizing a marathon as a reaction to an accident may sound strange , but at that time , even during my most vulnerable condition , I needed to dream big .
No matter where on Earth you live .
They say , &quot; You know , the state , it &apos;s necessary to fix these little market failures when you have public goods or different types of negative externalities like pollution , but you know what , what is the next big revolution going to be after the Internet ?
And , apart from the Mao period , that has remained more or less the case ever since .
I think you have to build dumb homes and put smart stuff in it .
And the mystery is to explain this peculiar number .
So I &apos;m reaching over . She &apos;s got the scarf on her right side .
The first shock is recorded as very painful .
You &apos;re going to be around for the next few days .
We have 12 million arrests every single year .
We have confused Maslow &apos;s hierarchy of needs just a little bit .
And together they started a book club for a hundred people in the slums , and they &apos;re reading many TED authors and liking it .
And I &apos;m thinking , it &apos;s because in that moment of them seeing an object they have no frame of reference for , or so transcends the frames of reference they have with the wheelchair , they have to think in a completely new way .
I survived that childhood through a mix of avoidance and endurance .
And so on . My career would probably last about five years .
And this is probably something I &apos;m going to share with you in Western media probably -- and how there &apos;s a lot of stereotypes -- thinking of Yemen in one single frame : this is what Yemen is all about .
She had to impersonate a man .
The little things in life , sometimes that we forget about , like pollination , that we take for granted .
He said , &quot; It &apos;s absolutely possible . &quot;
She thinks Burt Rutan is very impressive .
So I was almost ready to give up when one night I played around with these sentences and found out that there &apos;s actually a beautiful solution in here .
And I failed them dramatically , because I allowed it to go on and on and on .
So yeah , I &apos;m a newspaper cartoonist -- political cartoonist .
So I could do more large-scale projects .
That &apos;s the moment when you have to wake up from the automatic way of thinking .
The next 34 percent are your early majority , your late majority and your laggards .
Somebody has to take the lead , and I decided to do it .
It &apos;s great . Lots of NO is released .
He changed exactly one word : &quot; Heidi &quot; to &quot; Howard . &quot;
Already the old Chinese and the Greek , Hippocrates , have actually published , documented , that T.B. can be diagnosed based on the volatiles exuding from patients .
And that is how , maybe in the near future , light can help hospitals to make people better sooner , recover them quicker .
And so I had to divide it up into multiple panels that are 10 feet tall by 25 feet wide .
Thank you .
I like this question . It &apos;s about a water tank .
And the outcome is going to get resolved within a few decades .
You should see a lot of old stars next to that black hole .
Cool , yeah ?
We think of it as maybe too silly , too unnecessary .
I -- I like -- There was indeed reason to be nervous , and there were moments in which I did feel nervous , knowing the history of what has happened to people who &apos;ve taken controversial stands or discovered disquieting findings in the behavioral sciences .
And I looked at her , I remember that day , and I saw something beyond what I was seeing in Angeline .
And unless we address this invisibility , we are going to get the results that we are seeing , which is a gradual degradation and loss of this valuable natural asset .
That year she introduced me to dance , and thus began my tryst with classical dance .
I don &apos;t have the right answer .
There &apos;s an upside to the story .
Let me tell you something .
Complex civilizations do that , because they operate , most of the time , on the edge of chaos .
So they pulled back and they were looking at each other , and they were going , &quot; Okay , what skills do we have in this room ?
And there are those individuals who have incredible artistic abilities .
Heart disease kills more women at all ages than breast cancer .
There are these giant rocks flying out there , and they &apos;re hitting us , and they &apos;re doing damage to us , but we &apos;ve figured out how to do this , and all the pieces are in place to do this .
It seems so elementary .
This is what wars look like when they continue .
He said , &quot; For three years , my girlfriend and I , we &apos;ve made it this Sunday morning ritual to visit the PostSecret blog together and read the secrets out loud .
Mapendo , in Swahili , means great love .
I &apos;ve had to move that part across , but only a millimeter .
It just isn &apos;t appropriate .
And one must admire the imagination of John Locke .
Maria Bezaitis : The surprising need for strangeness
Because I was interested in integrating these two worlds , I thought of sticky notes .
So it &apos;s only been 20 years that women have been allowed to run the marathon .
What are the trends ? If we just prolong the trends , without any real advanced analysis , to 2050 , there are two things that can increase the energy use .
She managed to study English and learn that as a foreign language .
2.9 seconds .
But there &apos;s a problem , because up until maybe a decade ago , we were told that life was impossible and that we were the most incredible miracle in the universe .
But before I went out to photograph this component , I sort of wrestled with the notion of how do you make a picture of a dead shark that will resonate with readers You know , I think there &apos;s still a lot of people out there who think the only good shark is a dead shark .
It is dangerous for patients to recover from heart attacks at home .
But by now it &apos;s evident to everyone in this room . You &apos;re blind .
For me , the process is very important , because I &apos;m inventing machines , but I &apos;m also inventing tools to make machines , and the whole thing is all sort of wrapped up from the beginning .
But this story is much more than about household energy use .
Our instrument took this image of the veil of Venus , which turned out to be a smog of sulfuric acid .
You will say , &quot; Okay , this is nice -- a slide created in 10 minutes . &quot;
But no , I wasn &apos;t born there .
Also , it has been shown in other labs -- for instance , Paul Ekman &apos;s labs in Berkeley -- that some meditators are able , also , to control their emotional response more than it could be thought .
The government has invested in basic education , has invested in basic health .
In Mongolia for instance , where 30 percent of the people are nomadic , SMS information systems are being used to track migration and weather patterns .
It basically embeds the most fundamental building block of computing , the digital logic gate , directly into your parts .
I see it as kind of a book in three dimensions .
And there &apos;s a race to get to the Pole between Amundsen , the Norwegian -- Amundsen had dog sleds and huskies -- and Scott , the British guy , Captain Scott .
It &apos;s just a tiny sub-substructure , microscopic .
So we need a lot of innovation to offset this decline .
So , when you start to think about politicians , you &apos;ve got to realize these are strange creatures .
The real patient often wonders , where is everyone ?
And those who shunned politics , well , they were idiots .
We met her in a hospital in the Eastern Cape and spent a whole afternoon with her -- an adorable child .
And so we decided to do a research study to find out whether this was true or not .
So we kind of got a bit caught up with this , and we haven &apos;t really squared with you guys about what &apos;s really happening now , and it &apos;s about time we did .
And just as everybody got excited about it , bang !
And this is the result of the farmers-needs research .
A couple weeks later , I &apos;d call again , let them know .
I &apos;ll come back after two months .
They &apos;re about the same age . But that &apos;s about it .
And the one who was raping Evelyn came and defiled me also .
So every tool that we &apos;ve ever had in the past has eventually become ineffective .
And then they used public death records to find out who died .
And I still had this dream to make an actual , physical Luxo Jr. lamp .
Because we have real problems .
So this was the pre-bureaucratic age .
Above government , above markets was the direct rule of the people .
If we could free ourselves from our education ?
We see technology deeply impacting education and engaging people , from our youngest learners up to our oldest ones .
We don &apos;t know where they migrate to or from , where they mate , where they have their pups , and yet , hammerhead populations in the Atlantic have declined about 80 percent in the last 20 to 30 years .
Now , there &apos;s a similar situation in the classical music world , because there are some people who think that classical music is dying .
Lessons are interleaved sequences of videos and interactive exercises .
We ought to be able to lower supply to unprecedented low levels without killing the animal .
But it &apos;s important to remember that before we learned how to share the fruits of the Industrial Revolution with the broad swathes of society , we had to go through two depressions , the Great Depression of the 1930s , the Long Depression of the 1870s , two world wars , communist revolutions in Russia and in China , and an era of tremendous social and political upheaval in the West .
For example , no one can do two notes at the same time .
We showed them the whole cut , and they were all completely , what is this ?
So we came up with this protocell model here that I &apos;m showing .
All I did was codify it , and it &apos;s probably the world &apos;s simplest idea .
Every mental organ addressed . It really is .
This lady with bone TB , left alone in a tent , is going to die with her only daughter .
But you get about 80 percent of the way there , for about one percent of the cost .
E : Cock-a-doodle-doo !
It seems the more we know about how democracy works -- through government transparency , better media coverage , even new insights about our brains -- the less we trust democracy itself . Yet it &apos;s still , arguably , the best system of government available . As Ivan Krastev says , &quot; What went right is also what went wrong . &quot; Can democracy survive ?
There &apos;s no question , none , that so-called lifestyle diseases -- diabetes , heart disease , stroke , some cancers -- are diseases that are far more prevalent here than anywhere in the rest of the world .
Actually , the answer is more nuanced and subtle than that .
He said , &quot; Yeah , it &apos;s an amazing theory .
Ferdinand : Beyond all limit .
I have never been more terrified -- until now .
There are some very light people , some extremely heavy people , maybe people with a lot of bulk up top .
And I gave it back because I didn &apos;t want anybody thinking that I do what I do for money -- I don &apos;t .
And they really help molecules , like nucleic acids , like RNA and DNA , stay inside , develop , change , divide and do some of the processes that we call life .
The sensors that are used can see through the dark , the fog and rain .
So I &apos;m going to show you now , without the skin on it , a 30-second piece , and then I &apos;m done .
You know ?
Now , economists tend to -- -- economists tend to view the world through their own lenses , which is : this is just a bunch of stupid people .
I met her when she was nine , and since then , my team and I have been trying to build her a personalized voice .
From afar , they look alien-like , but when you look closer , they &apos;re all made out of black garbage bags or Tupperware containers .
They look like TV cameras , monitors , annoying radio mics .
It &apos;s a new brain . You needed it .
And I gathered together , honestly , the world &apos;s leading experts in every possible way .
It &apos;s kind of an odd thing to do with your Friday nights , but this is what I started doing , and I started collecting a whole group of my friends &apos; DNA in small vials and categorizing them .
I looked out the windows and I saw a full half-circle of explosion .
And that means it &apos;s harder for us to pay attention to the quiet , the subtle , the understated .
The other one sees that .
Same principles applied -- calculations , harder .
You should also keep your blood pressure down , because chronic high blood pressure is the biggest single risk factor for Alzheimer &apos;s disease .
But then , in the 1990s , studies starting showing , following the lead of Elizabeth Gould at Princeton and others , studies started showing the evidence of neurogenesis , the birth of new brain cells in the adult mammalian brain , first in the olfactory bulb , which is responsible for our sense of smell , then in the hippocampus involving short-term memory , and finally in the amygdala itself .
It literally is Waterhouse .
It &apos;s not nice to give them employment in our factories , our companies .
And the Qalandar people will rise above all this cruel barbaric past that they &apos;ve lived all their lives .
We have to change the norms .
Just type it into the box , and there &apos;s your answer .
Greece , you see , was only a preview of what is in store for us all .
So I &apos;m just going to go into a different step now , which is easier for me .
Our bumper sticker for this view is that this is the joy of debugging .
I went to the Democratic Republic of Congo .
People think that now that we have digital technology , the book is going to die , and we are seeing things shifting and things evolving .
I lived there with nothing but water .
Now not everything that can be done should be done .
And the father says , &quot; I &apos;m very sorry . Yes , it &apos;s true , I lied .
Can we all not systematically and consciously get infected ?
That &apos;s where those big peaks are over to the left .
So , the more tools you have , for Batman , more effective at fighting the bad guys , for us , more tools to attack these kinds of big problems .
I made this film because I felt it &apos;s important for it to speak to the Westerners about our history as a country .
So now the woman on the right is actually much happier than the guy on the left -- meaning that , if you have a lot of friends , and you have meaningful friendships , that does make a lot of difference .
This is Mahler .
It &apos;s a great honor today to share with you The Digital Universe , which was created for humanity to really see where we are in the universe .
Ten years ago exactly , I was in Afghanistan .
My friend Red Maxwell has spent the last 10 years fighting against juvenile diabetes .
We had to bring , in this case , the Arab League in .
Or in other words , I sometimes say , fire needs air .
The results are showing : independent monitoring by the World Bank and other organizations show that in many instances the trend is downwards in terms of corruption , and governance is improving .
Now we &apos;re at Alpha Centauri , our nearest neighbor star , and the planet is gone .
I think you see , you see them sweeping . You see them sweeping right here .
And they kill lions .

But there &apos;s another class of simple things , which are also very important .
You know , these last two cartoons -- I did them live during a conference in Hanoi .

I got him . The wave broke over us .

Create a shopping center , a swimming place that is more like a museum than like entertainment .
Now there is an epidemic of obesity : two-thirds of adults and 15 percent of kids . What &apos;s really concerning to me is that diabetes has increased 70 percent in the past 10 years , and this may be the first generation in which our kids live a shorter life span than we do . That &apos;s pitiful , and it &apos;s preventable .

It &apos;s a James Joyce quote .
For example , personality .
It &apos;s trying to recover .
I use spoken word to help my students rediscover wonder , to fight their instincts to be cool and unfazed and , instead , actively pursue being engaged with what goes on around them , so that they can reinterpret and create something from it .
As an aside , those of you who remember Dan Aykroyd in the 1970s doing Julia Child imitations can see where he got the idea of stabbing himself from this fabulous slide .
When I read that , I was blown away by those numbers .
As you leave here today , I would like to leave you with a very personal message , which is what it is that I believe we should be doing as individuals , and this is really about being open-minded , open-minded to the fact that our hopes and dreams of creating prosperity for people around the world , creating and meaningfully putting a dent in poverty for hundreds of millions of people , has to be based in being open-minded , because these systems have good things and they have bad things .
They &apos;re at a big disadvantage in hospitals .

This is just archaic , primitive common sense , and by using common sense , we went from 120 kilowatts per square meter per year , which is the typical energy consumption for cooling a glass tower , to 40 kilowatts per square meter per year .
The DVD , as you know , was introduced in the mid-1990s and it was quite expensive . But you can see that by 1998 , it had fallen below 400 dollars , and 400 dollars was a psychological threshold .
And here is what it does .
We secretly filmed some of the family of the former chief minister and a lawyer as they told our undercover investigator exactly how these dubious deals are done using such companies .

In my work with cattle , I noticed a lot of little things that most people don &apos;t notice would make the cattle balk . Like , for example , this flag waving , right in front of the veterinary facility .
Well , we haven &apos;t done that , so we can &apos;t really expect to find an answer when we &apos;re still afraid of the question .
Pretty much in every case , that &apos;s how a charity starts .
Tropical forests contain a huge amount of carbon in the trees , and we need to keep that carbon in those forests if we &apos;re going to avoid any further global warming .
I do not like guns .
Remember , until the 1970s , the spread of democracy has always been accompanied by the decline of inequality .
I remember , every time I went to a patient &apos;s deathbed , whether in the hospital or at home , I remember my sense of failure -- the feeling of I don &apos;t know what I have to say ; I don &apos;t know what I can say ; I don &apos;t know what I &apos;m supposed to do .
That was a relief to see that pour out of the machine .
Some of these are hopeless universes , completely sterile , with other kinds of pathologies like no notion of space , no notion of time , no matter , other problems like that .

I &apos;m going to show you another clip of a woman named Lydia .
I gave myself the problem .
It &apos;s a collection of floors , one on top of each other , with a core in the center with elevators , stairs , pipes , wires , everything , and then a glass skin on the outside that , due to direct sun radiation , creates a huge greenhouse effect inside .
We all feel younger than our real age , because the spirit never ages .
Throughout sports , technology has changed the face of performance .
In fact , here in the U.S. , 40 percent of food purchased for the home is wasted .

And you will fall , and you will die . Dangerous .
One way out of this metabolic limitation would be to spend even more hours per day eating , but that gets dangerous , and past a certain point , it &apos;s just not possible .
I think I inherit it from my mother , who , used to crawl around the house on all fours .
About four people probably read it , and they tell me , you know , &quot; You haven &apos;t updated &quot; -- I &apos;m probably going to get people telling me I haven &apos;t updated -- but this is something that &apos;s amazing , because I can go back to a day -- I can go back to April 2005 , and say , what was I doing this day ? I look at it , I know exactly .
Sound is complex . There are many countervailing influences .
It &apos;s bigger .

It &apos;s not uncommon for people to feel like they &apos;re alone or that nobody understands them , but spoken word teaches that if you have the ability to express yourself and the courage to present those stories and opinions , you could be rewarded with a room full of your peers , or your community , who will listen .
Well if 100 , if we think of 100 as being like a square , 75 would look like this .
Well , it might look a little bit like the 4,000 community-interest companies that have sprung up in the U.K. over the last five years and a similar rise in B corporations in the United States , enterprises that have ecological and social goals written into their constitution at their heart -- companies , in fact , like this one , Ecosia .

A treaty that decides who gets to do this .
These are smart guys -- men and women -- astronauts , like I said , engineers .
So that &apos;s the experiment we did .
So that what you could actually do was go into the room and write messages to the person who was sick in that room , which was lovely .
Let &apos;s see if we can come close to the edge of that live volcano . &quot;
And we were shocked .
In the European Union , they went in the other direction .
The first way is that you use larvicides .

Now we &apos;re going to change and look at the level of per capita income .
What &apos;s the schedule , Richard ?
This has been fantastic .
We tend to look at the world , not as the integrated system that it is , but as a series of individual issues .
A new form of arguing has been invented in our lifetimes , in the last decade , in fact .

But I , and a friend of mine from graduate school , we didn &apos;t see it that way .
Or , as we speak now , hundreds of thousands of Congolese women are getting raped and mutilated .
So the one who makes the choices -- that &apos;s the interesting part here -- for the one who makes the choices , it doesn &apos;t really matter .

So there is some sort of justice in the world after all .
See , we all know based on our own experience that when you sleep , it clears your mind , and when you don &apos;t sleep , it leaves your mind murky .

Every day I hope that politicians , diplomats , development workers can turn conflict into peace and threat into hope .
The whole thing about my house , the whole use of rough carpentry and everything , was the frustration with the crafts available .

If you &apos;re involved , say , in a travel industry in any way , look at pilgrimage .
I used to be a marathon runner .
It &apos;s semantic representation of comment , content , and what you can really think of XML in this case , is it &apos;s the packaging that we &apos;re putting around these pages .
So , in other words , it claimed it could deliver a message before you sent it .
That was 1984 .
So we are applying these blended learning pilots in a number of universities and high schools around the world , from Tsinghua in China to the National University of Mongolia in Mongolia to Berkeley in California -- And these kinds of technologies really help , the blended model can really help revolutionize education .
And me ?
Are your shoulders ready ?
You need to keep repeating the lesson 10 times a day .

Think of penguins as ocean sentinels , says Dee Boersma -- they &apos;re on the frontlines of sea change . Sharing stories of penguin life and culture , she suggests that we start listening to what penguins are telling us .
I feel so strongly that you cannot ask a small farmer to work the land and bend over to grow a hectare of rice , 150,000 times , just to plant a crop and weed it .
That &apos;s clearly enjoyable for myself .
Does yours go higher ?
A dung beetle has a brain the size of a grain of rice , and yet shows a tremendous amount of intelligence when it comes to rolling its food source -- animal excrement -- home . How ? It all comes down to a dance . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;

Matt Diffee is one of them .
I &apos;d want one to realize that defense usually wins championships , and would work hard on defense .
Thank you .
So a tremendous fund of knowledge despite , again , that so many people told her not to do it , it was too expensive .
And I &apos;d like to think of it as a 21st century wisdom table , really .
The threat , in fact , is this inversion of the burden of proof , where we suddenly are all treated like thieves at every moment we &apos;re given the freedom to create , to produce or to share .
There &apos;s nothing to water , nothing to maintain , and no undesirable people to worry about .
It was around this time we went from 1K to 16K , which was quite the leap .

And experiments don &apos;t work , experiments don &apos;t work , and then you tell everyone about it by publishing a paper that reads A arrow C , which is a great way to communicate , but as long as you don &apos;t forget the path that brought you there .
When photographed under a 3D microscope , grains of sand appear like colorful pieces of candy and the stamens in a flower become like fantastical spires at an amusement park . Gary Greenberg reveals the thrilling details of the micro world .
But actually , it &apos;s a tremendous problem , because how can we ever see differently ?
At this time we &apos;re living in the Bronx , and in the building next to where I lived there was a guy named Johnny .
They did it with puppies .
And listen to people . They have the solutions in front of you .
And that &apos;s the single most important thing that judges say when you talk to them .
We can make the circuitry of the right computational power , but we can &apos;t actually put them together to make something that will actually work and be as adaptive as these systems .
So the more people experiment with materials , the more researchers are willing to share their research , and manufacturers their knowledge , the better chances we have to create technologies that truly serve us all .
Please , continue to let us see characters in your movies , your plays , your columns , who suffer with severe mental illness .
Right ? Second , it is negative .

They &apos;re not even enjoying the show .
And we all fall at different points , of course , along the introvert / extrovert spectrum .
Well , we had a lot of them .
How will we be remembered in 200 years ?
That means they &apos;re totally out of sync in traditional classes , which are analog , static , interactively passive .
What are the things that they all do ?
And News , which I just mentioned , was started by a researcher .
And we asked them these questions , and we asked those questions of science graduates , and they couldn &apos;t answer them .
After puberty , we fall off the map .
Ocean -- probably the most likely place for life to originate , just as it originated on the Earth . So we would love to explore Europa , to go down through the ice , find out who is swimming around in the ocean , whether there are fish or seaweed or sea monsters -- whatever there may be that &apos;s exciting --- or cephalopods .
So at the risk of repeating myself a little bit , when I look at what &apos;s going on with digital technology these days , we are not anywhere near through with this journey , and when I look at what is happening to our economies and our societies , my single conclusion is that we ain &apos;t seen nothing yet . The best days are really ahead .
We &apos;ve turned seven billion only a few months ago .
And this is GDP per capita on this axis .
AR : You &apos;ve entertained all of these people in a wonderful way , better than you know .
This , for example , this gentleman is called Joseph .
However , grilled chicken poses a hidden danger .
I &apos;ve got solar PV on my roof .
When there &apos;s one piece of fruit , there &apos;s likely to be another piece of fruit nearby , and the ants that specialize on clustered resources use interactions for recruitment .
We &apos;re looking for a backer .
What &apos;s interesting about these systems models is how they reveal our various points of view .
The &quot; Hunger Winter , &quot; as it came to be known , killed some 10,000 people and weakened thousands more .
And by this weird quirk of alphabetical order of the nations , a lot of the low-lying states , like Kiribati and Nauru , they were seated at the very end of these immensely long rows .

By 2050 , we &apos;re going to have nine billion people -- all the scientists agree .
Desperate for a solution , we &apos;ve turned to engineering to design artificial components to replace our worn-out body parts , but in the midst of the modern buzz around the promises of a bionic body , shouldn &apos;t we stop and ask if there &apos;s a better , more natural way ?
So we can record information and then drive information back in -- sort of computing what the brain needs in order to augment its information processing .
Then we got home and we see the cat . And she goes , &quot; Mom , how do cats do it ? &quot;
And , again , this is , sort of , my notion of shit-against-the-wall pharmacology : you know certain fertilizers make the plant more healthy so you put more in .
So in less than a month , we went from one case of paralysis to a targeted vaccination program .
And we were like , &quot; Oh , tell us more .
And it &apos;s been terribly successful .
It was only by the turn of the century that more than 90 percent of the children survived their first year .
And at this point in the process we had to come in every couple of days to do a stress test on the baby , and this is just routine , it tests whether or not the baby is feeling any type of undue stress .
Or they burn the plastics to get to the metals in burn houses like you see here .

Imagine it says TED , because the comments can &apos;t be policed at any acceptable cost .
And this video , which I &apos;m going to let run through , was one we discovered a couple of weeks ago .
And it would be easy to implement and inexpensive .
And you can see , there is a physical space that has been created for him , parking that car , along with the owner &apos;s car , but more importantly , they &apos;ve created a space in their mind that &quot; Yes , my chauffeur is going to come in his own car and park it . &quot;
So a little unknown secret is -- did you see the one with the guy , he &apos;s got the Web cam ?

Thank you .
But you see those books you just signed for my wife and my three daughters ? &quot;
So , I started full focus .
And maybe stories are just data with a soul .

This is a new generation , a new family , which is able to store the winds .
I &apos;ve also spent some time surveying audiences in different parts of the world on what they actually guess these numbers to be .
We hope that the Embrace infant warmer and other simple innovations like this represent a new trend for the future of technology : simple , localized , affordable solutions that have the potential to make huge social impact .
In fact , we &apos;re more closely related to fungi than we are to any other kingdom .
They &apos;re not proof of deception .
And this is the same thing , money down there , and health , you know ?

Turns out there &apos;s some exceptions to that rule .
And as a young boy , I used to go up to Northern Michigan and fish in the rivers that Hemingway fished in and then later wrote about .
Now working memory has four basic components .
&quot; Well , yeah , yeah , that &apos;s part of the project . &quot;
I spend a lot of time teaching adults how to use visual language and doodling in the workplace .
But the severity of it and the seriousness of it is this : every 30 seconds , every 30 seconds , somewhere , someone in the world takes their own life because of depression , and it might be two blocks away , it might be two countries away , it might be two continents away , but it &apos;s happening , and it &apos;s happening every single day .
And a nurse from a hospital drove one right at that moment to the cafe I was in , and I bought her a smoothie and we sat there talking about nursing and death .
So why don &apos;t we ? Why don &apos;t we ?
They said , instead , if you want to see real creativity , go to Silicon Valley , and look at companies like Google , Microsoft , Intel .
And we need to be able to build this thing using simple manufacturing techniques and factories that don &apos;t cost us a fortune .
It appeals to pity . It appeals to something called charity .
Now I said back in our little thought experiment , you &apos;re a hominid walking on the plains of Africa .
And these are the inflection points that tell you what the next chapter in that technology &apos;s life is going to be , and maybe how you can do something about it .
Because this is about 10 dollars of additional hardware if you already have a Nintendo Wii .
&quot; Good . Buy us some land in Kings Mountain and announce we are going to build a major plant there . &quot;
So we &apos;re spending less than a dollar , OK , on lunch .

God no , it was therapy .
Here &apos;s a group of kids in a village in Pakistan near where I grew up .
What we &apos;ve been able to do is to give these virulent infections , but we give them in conjunction with our anti-quorum sensing molecules -- so these are molecules that look kind of like the real thing , but they &apos;re a little bit different which I &apos;ve depicted on this slide .
In terms of invention , I &apos;d like to tell you the tale of one of my favorite projects .

We evolved as a species near the equator , and so we &apos;re very well-equipped to deal with 12 hours of daylight and 12 hours of darkness .
Miranda : Do you love me ?
There are materials that do this . Here are the heart patches .
So a more direct one , one that gives you more of the feeling of math , is something closer to Pythagoras &apos; own proof , which goes like this : so here we have this triangle , and if we surround that C square with three more triangles and we copy that , notice that we can move those triangles down like this .
SR : So let &apos;s put all of this to the test now .
This is the first recovery ever observed of voluntary leg movement after an experimental lesion of the spinal cord leading to complete and permanent paralysis .
And I came back afterward on the sled of the helicopter back .
Everything just looks so gray around here , and looks so cold .
Instead , there are a dozen things , any one of which could do us in .

But Torvalds said , &quot; No , I &apos;m not going to do that . &quot;
Do you think you could go to the store and get a choice of power bars , like we can , and pick the right one to match ?
It was the sense of efficacy .
What &apos;s really interesting to me though is at the end of the game you get stats and feedback about how you did .
Imagine if instead of facing that , they could actually face the regeneration of that limb .
When it comes to restoration of hearing , we have certainly come a long way , a remarkably long way .
You need to have incentives .
There was a woman sitting in the middle of it , and this woman was waiting to hold us .
But actually these , like I said , are still the actual prototype .
It was also a great success on social media .

What should it be for ?
That was well chosen , I would say , for TEDWomen .

And when I present this in Africa -- Nairobi , Lagos , Accra -- I get one question .
I didn &apos;t know you actually have to have creative control .
So , we can even put a number to how many of those planets now do we expect our own Milky Way Galaxy harbors .

This is the first house I built .
And some of the people I speak to that have never seen a movie or been to the theater don &apos;t get it in the same way .
You &apos;ve got gravity , you &apos;ve got the centrifugal force , you &apos;ve got the fluid dynamics .

Not in the Middle East .
And about 10 minutes later , we were both spinning it in vials together and coming up with a protocol for human DNA extraction .
And I realized so clearly in bringing my own life experience , from working with dying people and training caregivers , that any attachment to outcome would distort deeply my own capacity to be fully present to the whole catastrophe .

And it explodes , and it shines as brightly as a billion suns for about two weeks , and releases , not only energy , but a huge amount of chemical elements into the universe .
He displaces the beetle , and now we have to see what is going to take place .

But just being wrong doesn &apos;t feel like anything .
And it &apos;s not only these JusticeMakers , but people we courageously see figure out who their networks are and how they can move it forward .

Now , there may be more or less natural or artificial stimuli for the experience , but even that is a matter of degree , not kind .
What happened back a few years ago was a group of theoretical physicists at MIT actually came up with this concept of transferring power over distance .
Think about your own work .
We all know that it &apos;s Bill .
A doctor comes in from a block away , stop us , checks the kid , and tells us to stop CPR .
Now why do I show a cauliflower , a very ordinary and ancient vegetable ?

Maybe it &apos;s going to rain .
And so I &apos;m going to try to talk to you over the next few minutes about my career in terms of how I &apos;m able to actually try to study music and really try to grapple with all these questions of how the brain is able to be creative .
And then , a psychologist , Alice Isen , did this wonderful experiment .
The lesson here is that some high-performance tasks are easier than others , and that understanding the physics of the problem tells you which ones are easy and which ones are hard .
If you do that tomorrow , I &apos;ll be dead , you &apos;ll be dead , every single one of the men will be dead .
So what happens for adults is we decide that something &apos;s relevant or important , we should pay attention to it .
We &apos;re kind of stuck in a loop , perhaps , and this sense of possibility from computing is something I &apos;ve been questioning for the last 10 or so years , and have looked to design , as we understand most things , and to understand design with our technology has been a passion of mine .
Week in , week out .

Why should we do this as Indians and Pakistanis ?
We all know from experience how it goes .
Mathematics is the language of science .
The self changed , got affected , broken , destroyed , but another one would evolve -- sometimes stronger , sometimes hateful , sometimes not wanting to be there at all .

And I think because early on , frankly , my programs were just a little bit ahead of their time .
So I started contacting them -- because they had actually given me a permit to do this -- and I said , &quot; I want to come up and tell you what we found . &quot;
There are plenty of downsides .
Then there is the case of poor people from villages , like me .
So it was the need and the people we saw in the early &apos; 90s -- that &apos;s what made us go back and work for them .
And there &apos;s much more solar than there is wind .
How does this happen ?
And thank you chemical processing industry that gave us time to read books . &quot;
First of all , we need to find more robust , good and reliable biological solutions , more good bugs that we can either mass-produce or actually conserve in the field .
And if you look even closer , you &apos;ll see , in that limestone , there are little shells and little skeletons that are piled upon each other .
Now what about goals ? Where are we going toward ?
I have a doppelganger .
There you go . 70 cabinet ministers , 114 presidential advisers , by the way , who never see the president , except on television .

So whereas in the adults , as I told you , this brain region is almost completely specialized -- it does almost nothing else except for thinking about other people &apos;s thoughts -- in children it &apos;s much less so , when they are age five to eight , the age range of the children I just showed you .
It &apos;s typical of these hallucinations that they may come in a flash and disappear in a flash .

So , this oak-paneled room , and she was there with her mother , and she was led and sat on this chair at the end , and she sat on her hands for 20 minutes while this man talked to her mother about all the problems Gillian was having at school . And at the end of it -- because she was disturbing people ; her homework was always late ; and so on , little kid of eight -- in the end , the doctor went and sat next to Gillian and said , &quot; Gillian , I &apos;ve listened to all these things that your mother &apos;s told me , and I need to speak to her privately . &quot;

It &apos;s amazing to think that this is actually on earth ; it looks like aliens in an alien environment .
Thank you very much .
Second , diplomacy .
Because normal contracting for things , when you &apos;re spending government money , you &apos;re spending our money , tax money , and the people who are in charge of that are very aware of it so the temptation is to control exactly how you spend it .
How can you say something is low-fat when it &apos;s full of so much sugar ?
I &apos;m an archeological geneticist at the Center for Evolutionary Medicine at the University of Zurich , and I study the origins and evolution of human health and disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient humans .
Take Copenhagen last year -- complete failure of governments to do the right thing in the face of an international challenge .
I don &apos;t know if this is called a basket-bra , but it ought to be something like that .

But what you get out of such an exercise is simply a list of genes .
There was nothing ready , and , you know , as we can see by what they &apos;re doing .
This particular Moai , these five ladies have been together for 97 years .
We believe we have performed responsible releases .
But frankly there are enough differences within the country now where maybe you can take a bunch of kids from NYU , have them go study for a semester at the University of Arkansas , and vice versa . Do it at the high school level .
In fact , we &apos;ve shown recently that these regions here in white respond whenever you do any difficult mental task at all — well , of the seven that we &apos;ve tested .

The last thing I want to say before turning it over to questions is that the extensive work that we &apos;ve done -- asking for ethical review , pushing the envelope on that side as well as the technical side -- this has been broadly discussed in the scientific community , in the policy community and at the highest levels of the federal government .
Why is this happening ?
We &apos;re made of cells and stuff between cells .

And what we &apos;d like to say with &quot; Yes is More &quot; is basically trying to question this idea that the architectural avant-garde is almost always negatively defined , as who or what we are against .
&quot; Men fight wars , and women mourn them , &quot; says documentary photographer Anastasia Taylor-Lind . With stark , arresting images from the Maidan protests in Ukraine , the TED Fellow shows us intimate faces from the revolution . A grim and beautiful talk .

That did end up with vulnerable people in Afghanistan being exposed . It also meant that the Belarussian dictator was given a handy list of all the pro-democracy campaigners in that country who had spoken to the U.S. government .
And indeed , you do see it in the human entorhinal cortex , which is the same part of the brain that you see grid cells in rats .
And I am not a complete pacifist like some of my really , really heavy-duty , non-violent friends , like Mairead McGuire .
It &apos;s an art of communication .
So one of my graduate students , John Scannella , looked through our whole collection and he actually discovered that the hole starting to form in Triceratops and , of course it &apos;s open , in Torosaurus -- so he found the transitional ones between Triceratops and Torosaurus , which was pretty cool .

First , we &apos;ve got to be ready and willing to take experts on and dispense with this notion of them as modern-day apostles .
Because our business has refused to use science .
&quot; Life comes at us very quickly , and what we need to do is take that amorphous flow of experience and somehow extract meaning from it . &quot; In this funny , enlightening talk , educational psychologist Peter Doolittle details the importance -- and limitations -- of your &quot; working memory , &quot; that part of the brain that allows us to make sense of what &apos;s happening right now .

These micro-machines , which are the envy of nanotechnologists the world over , are self-directed , powerful , precise , accurate devices that are made out of strings of amino acids .
See , our pattern detection device , which appears to be located in the anterior cingulate cortex -- it &apos;s our little detection device there -- can be easily fooled , and this is the problem .
On your right-hand side you can see a cucumber leaf , and on the middle , cotton leaf , and on the left a tomato leaf with these little stipplings .
And so we started thinking about all the different things that could go wrong .
It comes back to instinct .
Now , the story that plants are some low-level organisms has been formalized many times ago by Aristotle , that in &quot; De Anima &quot; -- that is a very influential book for the Western civilization -- wrote that the plants are on the edge between living and not living .
It &apos;s just making you expect the detail .
What is known as the Bureau of Indian Affairs was created within the War Department , setting an early tone of aggression in our dealings with the Native Americans .
But still , I have a huge pile of fake happy childhood pictures and I &apos;m glad they make me less likely than some people to get a divorce .
It looks like it &apos;s happening kind of quickly , but it &apos;s actually a very slow computer , and when I realized how slow this computer was compared to how fast a computer is , it made me wonder about computers and technology in general .
JD Schramm : Break the silence for suicide attempt survivors
I find it such a profound one .
So yes , when the backup systems are put in place , I &apos;m okay , I go in . Risky , yes , but it &apos;s a hazard of a profession .

Daphne Bavelier : Your brain on video games
Students lack perseverance .
I want to tell you that .
They say , &quot; Oh , yeah . They &apos;re always talking about that stuff .
So in my lab , we bring adolescents and adults into the lab to have a brain scan , we give them some kind of task that involves thinking about other people , their minds , their mental states , their emotions , and one of the findings that we &apos;ve found several times now , as have other labs around the world , is part of the prefrontal cortex called medial prefrontal cortex , which is shown in blue on the slide , and it &apos;s right in the middle of prefrontal cortex in the midline of your head .
Well that &apos;s going to be a breeding ground for compassion .
In the computer , you have all the data going through the central processing unit , and any piece of data basically has to go through that bottleneck , whereas in the brain , what you have is these neurons , and the data just really flows through a network of connections among the neurons . There &apos;s no bottleneck here .
For example , it &apos;s said that there are more people in India with access to cell phones than toilets .
And a consensus developed between all of us who were guiding people in that area that that herd was in fact moving slower to accommodate that elephant .

The first thing I want to do is say thank you to all of you .
So here is what we did . We put a 10-cent digital transponder , a data tag , in the appliance plug .
So what I did is I took all of the interviews where I saw worthiness , where I saw people living that way , and just looked at those .
But then something even more interesting happens .
We &apos;re on our way to solving -- and as I said earlier , I know we &apos;ve got a long way to go -- the one big issue that we &apos;re all focused on that threatens it , and that &apos;s the environmental issue , but I believe we all must turn all of our effort and all of our ingenuity and determination to help now solve this notion of global gridlock .
This is Picasso , of course embodying so much of it from the 20th century .
I &apos;m like , &quot; No , why would I get itchy down there ? &quot;

This one went as follows : All societies , regardless of culture , be it Christian , Muslim , Confucian , must progress from traditional societies in which groups are the basic units to modern societies in which atomized individuals are the sovereign units , and all these individuals are , by definition , rational , and they all want one thing : the vote .
They &apos;re about doing surveillance on people they know are innocent .
Dying from cancer and dying from neurological illness are different .
They &apos;re Christians .
So again , here we are at that equator moment .
BJ : But through our investigation , we have to seek the wildest places in Africa .
Where does that leave democracy aspirants ?
He did it because he couldn &apos;t afford a car , but also because he knew how to build one .
For example , we did books -- not for sale -- that all the community would get .
You can see on a graph , after years of stagnation , the paper started to grow , just after redesign .
This is the other side of the things that we like .
I do that because I believe that Dorothy , like Pia , deserves the best life chances that we can afford to give her .
Thank you .
And I came back to measure what we technically call the half-lifetime of Coke -- how long does it last in the refrigerators ?
No , it is .
One of the big reasons is , we think success is a one-way street .
If she fails , we &apos;re all headed to the gallows ; if she passes , we can leave to Vietnam .
When images are formed , a higher part of the visual cortex is involved in the temporal lobe .
Or do they ?
If there are cells in my body that live all 80 years , as opposed to a typical , you know , couple of months ?
Ferrofluid has a very strange behavior .
In other words , they have a shared and growing complexity in visual language that happens in a predictable order .
Now we actually have been doing it for a long time .
So then there was a lot more beers , and then the day ended with a challenge to bring the mustache back .
Six thousand reviews each school week vying for the honor of being review of the week .
Well , we had data that told a different story .
And this is essential to the progress of science , or exploration of what is possible .
Because I think we really need the Internet to be that thing that we all dreamed of it being .
And this cell is one of the thousands of kinds of cell that we are learning about .
But these people , they tend to tell you that not only can they communicate with the dead -- &quot; Hi , there &quot; -- but they can hear the dead as well , and they can relay this information back to the living .
He and I were together on the panel , and just before delivering our papers — we didn &apos;t know each other &apos;s papers — we decided to take chance seriously .
Anonymous companies protect corrupt individuals – from notorious drug cartel leaders to nefarious arms dealers – behind a shroud of mystery that makes it almost impossible to find and hold them responsible . But anti-corruption activist Charmian Gooch hopes to change all that . At TED2014 , she shares her brave TED Prize wish : to know who owns and controls companies , to change the law , and to launch a new era of openness in business .
Now when it comes to taxes , there is more disagreement .
This is absolutely beautiful stuff .
I &apos;d like to make the suggestion that we don &apos;t need to aim for that to make substantial progress from where we are .
And , by the way , he gave the &quot; I have a dream &quot; speech , not the &quot; I have a plan &quot; speech .
Then they have to learn the anatomy , and they &apos;ve got to learn the physiology .
Plenty of robots can fly -- but none can fly like a real bird . That is , until Markus Fischer and his team at Festo built SmartBird , a large , lightweight robot , modeled on a seagull , that flies by flapping its wings . A soaring demo fresh from TEDGlobal 2011 .
And divides anew every 12 to 15 hours .
Same thing is going on .
This first cliff , in 1956 , is the introduction of the flip turn .
And the first place we &apos;ve done that is in Southern Siberia in the Altai Mountains at a place called Denisova , a cave site in this mountain here , where archeologists in 2008 found a tiny little piece of bone -- this is a copy of it -- that they realized came from the last phalanx of a little finger of a pinky of a human .
I &apos;ve got parent-child relational problems , which I blame my parents for .
So , instead of having a situation where only the police have the information about which crimes are committed where , and we have to employ people in government to try and hold the police to account , suddenly , we &apos;ve got this vast opportunity for people power , where we , as citizens , can see what crimes are being committed -- where , when and by whom -- and we can hold the police to account .
Moreover , almost all these genetic variants we see outside Africa have closely related DNA sequences that you find inside Africa .
Social impact bonds work great for any area where there is at the moment very expensive provision that produces poor outcomes for people .
So , we moved from an agrarian economy to an industrial economy .
You kind of shout out the sound , S -- and the word comes .
And I do put power tools into the hands of second-graders .
There was only one variable that separated the people who have a strong sense of love and belonging and the people who really struggle for it .
But the truth of the matter is that this is going on .
How could these performances have escalated to this enormous degree ?
Is that possible ? Yes , it is , by recording myself like this .
And those were the ones who were even curious enough to say anything .
Since we know people want to be happy , maybe when our minds wander , they &apos;re going to someplace happier than the place that they &apos;re leaving . It would make a lot of sense .
And gratefully , it didn &apos;t .
Compassion is a piece of vocabulary that could change us if we truly let it sink into the standards to which we hold ourselves and others , both in our private and in our civic spaces .
So , I decided to dive in head first , and try to live the Bible .
If we started to think about food and how we feed our kids as a health initiative , and we started thinking about food as health , then I think we wouldn &apos;t have corn dogs as lunch .
But then -- and here &apos;s the trick -- Fehr and Gachter said , on the seventh round , they told people , &quot; You know what ? New rule .
And so we came up with the bright idea that instead of getting people to walk 10 , 15 kilometers to see doctors , you get the doctors to the people .
Let &apos;s take a look at San Francisco .
We also have another hemozoin-oriented therapy for malaria : a way , in acute cases , to actually take the malaria parasite and filter it out of the blood system .
JN : Yeah .
We have a lot of interesting information about what complexity is .
Well , with cards , most people tend to draw clear , more detailed , and more logical nodes .
And I &apos;ll put it to all of you , what you already know , that no problem worth solving is that simple .
And I saw that there was information there .
Things with rules as simple as these can do it .
One day , I was lying in bed watching CNN , when I was amazed by Professor Charlie Kemp of the Healthcare Robotics Lab at Georgia Tech demonstrating a PR2 robot .
And beyond the walls of our lab , we &apos;re even beginning to see signs of change in society .
We converted this into an ashram -- from a prison to an ashram through education .
It &apos;s a world of peace and prosperity and sustainability .
Now , of course , the man was very impressed with this young man of 17 who could immediately give him the formula , so he recruited him .
Shortly after the conference was over , Joel got a request for a signed copy from the head of the EPA in Washington whose wall it now hangs on .
It &apos;s so clear , yet they &apos;re in denial . &quot;
Same color , same message , same words .
Because her machine doesn &apos;t work when there &apos;s no power .
And I &apos;m going to show you one or two of them .
And as she was talking , a thought came to my mind .
Are the basics of driving a car learning how to service it , or design it for that matter ?
And thus began my life-long passion for writing fiction .
And I think that we &apos;re going to really see a huge -- it may not even come from us ; there &apos;s all kinds of innovation going on .
I started working in the industry , but I wasn &apos;t really happy to contribute to a material consumer society in a linear , extracting and manufacturing mode .
So the rhythms could be pretty intact too , pretty concise .
And so , it &apos;s the profound thing that Richard talks about : to understand anything , you just need to understand the little bits ; a little bit about everything that surrounds it .
So Bill can look at the big data and say , &quot; I want to act based on these global statistics . &quot;
My lab at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology focuses on spinal cord injury , which affects more than 50,000 people around the world every year , with dramatic consequences for affected individuals , whose life literally shatters in a matter of a handful of seconds .
And as I said , the trouble with this is that , in the developing world there just aren &apos;t teachers to make this model work .
Shlomo Benartzi : Saving for tomorrow , tomorrow
I had learned to read music by then , or slowly learning to read music .
Thank you very much .
But one week , a couple months ago , I got a question that was actually about Google .
But we &apos;ve also discovered , when it comes to plants , in plants , as much as we understand and are starting to understand their genomes , it is the ecosystem around them , it is the microbes that live in their root systems , that have just as much impact on the character of those plants as the metabolic pathways of the plants themselves .
New Milk Carton : I &apos;m New Milk .
On my seventeenth birthday , as Janis Ian would best say , I learned the truth at 17 .
China &apos;s highest ruling body , the Politburo , has 25 members .
And so what I want you to remember from this talk are three things .
We need other parallel strategies coming online .
We can think , really , that each one is sort of beyond the imagination of the inventor of the previous one , if you like .
We all know about the Albert Einstein who came up with E = mc2 .
You &apos;ve got two options .
And David and I discovered that we had a question in common , that we really wanted the answer to , and that was , &quot; Why hasn &apos;t anybody built any computer games for little girls ? &quot;
It &apos;s just about 20 years ago , June 1994 , when Intel announced that there was a flaw at the core of their Pentium chip .
It has huge implications , even with this whole notion that we have on where , when and why we should actually be cutting back on public spending and different types of public services which , of course , as we know , are increasingly being outsourced because of this juxtaposition .
I don &apos;t even know who it is . &quot; My father always said , &quot; No one gives a shit . &quot; And all of a sudden , somebody I don &apos;t know , they &apos;re not asking for anything , they &apos;re just giving our family food , looking out for us . It made me believe this : &quot; What does it mean that strangers care ? &quot; And what that made me decide is , if strangers care about me and my family , I care about them .
And , as Chris says , there is a hunger for videos of me .
Think of all the years reformers of various stripes have tried to get rid of corruption in Russia , for instance , or how hard it is to re-regulate the banks even after the most profound financial crisis since the Great Depression , or even how difficult it is to get the big multinational companies , including those whose motto might be &quot; don &apos;t do evil , &quot; to pay taxes at a rate even approaching that paid by the middle class .
And the market research , consumer research , asking the Boomers and Gen Y what it is they would like , what they would like to live in , tells us there is going to be a huge demand -- and we &apos;re already seeing it -- for more urban lifestyles within suburbia .
Seven days later , Eric was set free and was able to return home .
But the book is not the best shape for the dictionary .
Thank you .
The music was in some ways different , but in structure and form , very much the same .
It goes straight . That &apos;s a big revelation for nine-year-olds .
And we sat down , and I shared with him my vision of getting men growing mustaches across Australia , raising awareness for this cause , and funds for his organization . And I needed a partnership to legitimately do that .
Over 200 people died .
That &apos;s the place where the heat is even to within 10 percent .
Of course , I &apos;m not sure they &apos;ll be up to it . &quot;
So the businesses are getting out their checkbooks .
You &apos;re sitting on chairs .
And they &apos;ve thought , &quot; Oh , what a horrible religion that is which ordains something like that . &quot;
If you don &apos;t remember anything else from this talk , three grams a day of fish oil can reduce your risk of a heart attack and sudden death by 50 to 80 percent .
That &apos;s what &apos;s happening to the water inside that popcorn .
If we all do that we move to a state that I like to think will be sound living in the world .
Meat is a very different story because , of course , animals could walk into the city .
So I doused him in cologne every day , which he thought was very nice , and therefore he brought bread and butter every day , which I had to eat out of courtesy .
It &apos;s man-made and can be overcome and eradicated by the actions of human beings . &quot;
May God forgive you .
So I decided to follow all the rules of the Bible .
And then Stygimoloch , another dinosaur from the same age , lived at the same time , has spikes sticking out the back of its head .
You can be future-oriented , setting goals .
Although you &apos;re looking for a drug that can solve aging in old men like me , what you could do now pretty well in the lab , if you were allowed ethically , is start a human life from scratch with altered genes that would make it live for a lot longer ?
AM : Yes , well , you know , I &apos;d won everything as far as the disabled meets -- everything I competed in -- and , you know , training in Georgetown and knowing that I was going to have to get used to seeing the backs of all these women &apos;s shirts -- you know , I &apos;m running against the next Flo-Jo -- and they &apos;re all looking at me like , &quot; Hmm , what &apos;s , you know , what &apos;s going on here ? &quot;
These two things have to come together .
And there &apos;s much more coming .
So , there is nothing right or wrong in what you do in life .
Could the sun activate those stores into the circulation , and there in the circulation do its good things for your cardiovascular system ?
Imagine what the world was like 40 years ago when it was just the Saturday Evening Post and Time and Newsweek .
The first really big health issue is a word that Murray Schafer coined : &quot; schizophonia . &quot;
&quot; If that &apos;s really why everyone was dying , the doctors would have told us . &quot;
Again though , to make it come alive you need , somehow , to add the human element .
And when I do that , your Frank turns around .
Time passed , and they thought he had surely forgotten them , at first .
It really was . I mean , the probability of failure was massive .
And be careful , your genes are in danger .
On the other end of the spectrum , we have a Dionysian perspective , which is more given to the passions and intuition , tolerant of organic texture and human gesture .
A very unlikely spokesperson for the idea of separation of church and state .
Wipe it up , throw it away .
And then , what &apos;s next ?
But we &apos;re at risk , because actually it &apos;s the opposite that &apos;s true .
This is the only project that we &apos;ve done where the finished thing looked more like a rendering than our renderings .
And when it nuzzles the button , the electric shock stops .
So I just want to quickly explain how this would work .
&quot; Why would I do that ?
This is a rancher in Texas , by William Albert Allard , a great portraitist .
We observe facial expressions , body language , and we can intuit feelings and emotions from our dialogue with one another .
And they get a picture of their whale too .
We &apos;re about to take a break in a moment .
&quot; Give me liberty or give me death &quot; is all well and good if you can afford it , but if you &apos;re living on less than one dollar a day , you &apos;re far too busy trying to survive and to provide for your family than to spend your time going around trying to proclaim and defend democracy .
Two terawatt hours , it &apos;s roughly half what the U.S. solar industry produced last year .
Mine was 146 .
This is what I understand from my faith tradition , and this is what I understand from my studies of other faith traditions , and this is the common platform on which we must all stand , and when we stand on this platform as such , I am convinced that we can make a wonderful world .
TM : Thank you very much .
Now , psychoanalysts know very well that people surprisingly don &apos;t have passion for knowledge but passion for ignorance .
Because what that question assumes is that our external world is predictive of our happiness levels , when in reality , if I know everything about your external world , I can only predict 10 percent of your long-term happiness .
What we could not have foreseen was the measurable improvements in behavior , confidence and academic achievement .
So that is a fact .
So these Connecticut dentists decided that they wanted to get people to brush their teeth and floss their teeth more often , and they were going to use one variable : they wanted to scare them .
But when he reached the mountain peak , he found the peak covered with countless flags of world-conquerors before him , each one claiming &quot; &apos; I was here first &apos; ...
So this is a bypass operation , just like what Al Gore had , with a difference .
We &apos;ve seen the creation of small computers in the &apos; 70s and early &apos; 80s , and who would have thought back then that every single person would not have just one computer but probably 20 , in your home , and in not just your P.C. but in every device -- in your washing machine , your cell phone .
This technology was developed by Tao Ju , who worked at our institute .
And this really is the moment when our relationship , both with food and cities , changes completely .
They &apos;re facing a force that they haven &apos;t faced before .
If they liked an aria , they would holler and suggest that it be done again as an encore , not at the end of the show , but immediately .
So that &apos;s been what we &apos;ve seen in Cayman , it &apos;s been what we &apos;ve seen in Brazil in those trials .
I wish I could tell that to my daughter .
In the U.S. , I worked in a research center , part-time , while taking graduate classes in economics .
As a teenager , I was sketching , drawing , and I wanted to be an artist .
They were touring one of the new modern factories , and Ford playfully turns to Reuther and says , &quot; Hey Walter , how are you going to get these robots to pay union dues ? &quot;
So what you see here is not a rock concert .
And we used to see the most mysterious animals out the window that you couldn &apos;t describe : these blinking lights -- a world of bioluminescence , like fireflies .
They made a donation to an organization based in Arkansas called Heifer International .
Remember when this blue box was all alone , leading the world , living its own life .
They were just there , but they had no significance .
And why this is interesting is that if you put on , say , a pair of safety glasses , that have two infrared dots in them , what these two dots are essentially going to give you is , give the computer an approximation of your head location .
Still , we very much wanted to see the aircraft that we &apos;d all helped build in the air , off the ground , like it was supposed to be .
Take a look at one of our spots .
But the last article in that issue was written by Francis Crick of DNA fame .
It acts as a self-fulfilling prophecy .
And then use that information to fuel solutions ?
To make sure as few things as possible go wrong , we have all these procedures around the election .
I showed him and Maria a zooplankton trawl from the gyre north of Hawaii with more plastic than plankton .
But with Sarah Brosnan we started out with capuchin monkeys .
One of the really exciting things is looking at solar water disinfection and improving the ability to be able to do that .
I may be a little taller . I actually can put both of them on .
Reaching success , I worked hard , I pushed myself .
Now we &apos;re already starting to see some experiments here .
And I think one of my favorite parts of this project was not just shooting a video with lasers , but we also open sourced it , and we made it released as a Google Code project , where people could download a bunch of the data and some source code to build their own versions of it .
If , on the other hand , you speak a futureless language , the present and the future , you speak about them identically .
So you &apos;ve got a lot of information . That &apos;s great .
The new breed of high-tech self-monitors might seem targeted at competitive athletes . But Talithia Williams , a statistician , makes a compelling case that all of us should be measuring and recording simple data about our bodies every day — because our own data can reveal much more than even our doctors may know .
&quot; Toughness ? Well , we was in West Jordan , Utah , and this bull shoved my face right through the metal shoots in a -- you know , busted my face all up and had to go to the hospital .
Bart Knols : Cheese , dogs and a pill to kill mosquitoes and end malaria
And one of the molecules I study is called isoprene , which is here . It &apos;s a small organic molecule . You &apos;ve probably never heard of it .
I &apos;m excavating and I &apos;m trying to maximize the potential and discover as much as I possibly can and exposing it within my own work .
Now we had an interest in getting tissue samples for genetics because we knew they were very valuable .
So far .
I expect health and joy and family and community .
This is why spouses in happy marriages tend to think that their husband or wife looks much better than anyone else thinks that they do .
There is a big schism between the ones who make gospel animals and porn animals , but -- they do a lot of really cool stuff with balloons .
We &apos;ve all experienced this .
The second challenge is the actual device for observing brainwaves .
Tesla , what is 236 multiplied by 501 ?
Thank you .
This same mechanism , we hope , will allow these patients , not only to imagine again the movements that they want to make and translate them into movements of this new body , but for this body to be assimilated as the new body that the brain controls .
The librarians were afraid their jobs were going to disappear .
A famous quotation can be found -- if you look on the web , you can find it in literally scores of English core syllabuses -- &quot; In or about December 1910 , human nature changed . &quot;
I don &apos;t have to explain to you what kind of risk he took for that action .
Question is : where &apos;s the third side there ?
I should also note that the &#91; discretionary &#93; spending , which is about 19 percent of the budget , that is Democratic and Republican issues , so you do have welfare , food stamps , other programs that tend to be popular among Democrats , but you also have the farm bill and all sorts of Department of Interior inducements for oil drilling and other things , which tend to be popular among Republicans .
Now , I don &apos;t play the flute or the clarinet , so I decided to combine these keys with an instrument I do play : the television remote control .
What a puzzle -- I wonder why .
How we build things can change as well .
Obviously nobody has been able to go back to 1930 , get all the people born in one maternity unit , and half of them eat lots of fruit and veg and olive oil , and then half of them eat McDonald &apos;s , and then we see how many wrinkles you &apos;ve got later .
The violin , which meant everything to me , became a grave burden on me .
But people did pay attention to what clothes I had .
People were taking shots and photos ; people were reporting violations of human rights in Egypt ; people were suggesting ideas , they were actually voting on ideas , and then they were executing the ideas ; people were creating videos .
Turns out we kind of do a reasonable job .
People might actually start sending out agendas . Imagine !
It was an experimental education program .
So Luke , before last night , when &apos;s the last time you saw Tony ?
Imagine you &apos;re a shipwrecked sailor adrift in the enormous Pacific . You can choose one of three directions and save yourself and your shipmates -- but each choice comes with a fearful consequence too . How do you choose ? In telling the story of the whaleship Essex , novelist Karen Thompson Walker shows how fear propels imagination , as it forces us to imagine the possible futures and how to cope with them .
And would we revert back to being more like animals , more primal modes of communication ?
And you stop , and you get out of your car and you take a picture .
This was taken in the old Croton Aqueduct , which supplied fresh water to New York City for the first time .
We have a pattern detection problem that is assessing the difference between a Type I and a Type II error is highly problematic , especially in split-second , life-and-death situations .
Some lasted 14-and-a-half minutes .
Beautiful words about the power of science and exploration .
Now , one of the problems with looking at blood pressure is your body does everything it can to keep your blood pressure at the same place .
Let &apos;s tell the quad to come back here and let the pole drop , and I will next demonstrate the importance of understanding physical models and the workings of the physical world .
All we need is a few hours of speech from our surrogate talker , and as little as a vowel from our target talker , to create a unique vocal identity .
And I &apos;m not alone .
Such a discovery might have saved Steve Titus , the man whose whole future was snatched away by a false memory .
are Nike T-shirts that are almost identical to one another .
Well , let me see , it &apos;s a quadrocopter , but what &apos;s kind of special about it is there &apos;s a leash .
J Well , my parents were in the movie business and then on the run from a cult , so the combination between the two ...
And the beauty of it is that even though it need only take about 10 minutes a day , it impacts our entire life .
For an example , the core of TPS , Toyota Production System , lies in heijunka , which is making manufacturing of different models of cars on a single assembly line .
But the simple English translation -- much less precise , but it captures the gist of what Bernoulli had to say -- was this : The expected value of any of our actions -- that is , the goodness that we can count on getting -- is the product of two simple things : the odds that this action will allow us to gain something , and the value of that gain to us .
In 1979 I had a chance to put my footprints on the ocean floor while using this personal submersible called Jim .
Why ? Because I told you we want to use these games for education or for rehabilitation . We need to have effects that are going to be long-lasting .
You just take your position and play the game .
We are now in a system where anyone can rise to any position they please .
There &apos;s fluid flowing across these cells , so we can begin to interconnect multiple different chips together to form what we call a virtual human on a chip .
My colleagues said , &quot; No , it &apos;s a simple solution .
I used to work as the director of the World Bank office in Nairobi for East Africa .
In a brilliantly tongue-in-cheek analysis , Sebastian Wernicke turns the tools of statistical analysis on TEDTalks , to come up with a metric for creating &quot; the optimum TEDTalk &quot; based on user ratings . How do you rate it ? &quot; Jaw-dropping &quot; ? &quot; Unconvincing &quot; ? Or just plain &quot; Funny &quot; ?
It &apos;s good to start with some examples .
This is an unbelievably primitive emotional response .
They , in fact , berate it .
And the only way you can solve these problems -- and this is where many greatest challenges are coming in this century -- is through cooperation , through working together , which means that soft power becomes more important , that ability to organize networks to deal with these kinds of problems and to be able to get cooperation .
But at the same time , we &apos;ve also gotten to know many wonderful colleagues and collaborators who share our vision and see the potential of conservation drones .
And so there is certainly a lot of hope , but there &apos;s a lot more that needs to be done .
Governments snatch short-term opportunities and , by the end of the conflict , the chickens have come home to roost .
Cuttlefish . I love cuttlefish . This is a Giant Australian Cuttlefish .
Here &apos;s a stat worth knowing : In the UK , 63 % of men who finish short-term prison sentences are back inside within a year for another crime . Helping them stay outside involves job training , classes , therapy . And it would pay off handsomely -- but the government can &apos;t find the funds . Toby Eccles shares an imaginative idea for how to change that : the Social Impact Bond . It &apos;s an unusual bond that helps fund initiatives with a social goal through private money -- with the government paying back the investors if the initiatives work .
Let me just give you a few examples , first of rules and the war on moral skill .
Every time something didn &apos;t work , we just threw in the towel and said , &quot; Let &apos;s forget it . &quot; Right ?
And with some very creative solutions .
I developed a really simple scoring system for slaughter plants where you just measure outcomes : How many cattle fell down ?
But physicians have another characteristic .
We gave people this horrible-tasting drink that affected their tryptophan levels .
Just as an indication , whereas a microscopist can process 40 samples in a day , a rat can process the same amount of samples in seven minutes only .
Since then we have taken pictures of dozens of these nests from around various parts of Southeast Asia , and we &apos;re now working with computer scientists to develop algorithms that can automatically count the number of nests from the thousands of photos we &apos;ve collected so far .
That was a challenge we had to face as physicists .
And those people , when they make their decisions in that format -- we &apos;re going to call them &quot; present-oriented , &quot; because their focus is what is now .
In fact it &apos;s -- -- exactly .
The first was just the screen .
And we walk out , and we look at each other , and we say , &quot; How did you do ? &quot;
We also changed the way we did criminal prosecutions .
Thank you , TED .
In fact , when we &apos;re traveling abroad , it &apos;s how we identify fellow Canadians .
So , you &apos;re getting the pattern . First 200 children at Riverside .
And my dad said , &quot; Yeah , but , honey , I think that &apos;s technically just between Thanksgiving and Christmas . &quot;
I was so determined to be a teacher now so that I could make a difference in my family .
They fit together in a network that &apos;s starting to make sense now in terms of how the brain functions .
And what you can see here is the beginning of an industry in a test tube , a mining industry that is in harmony with nature .
And everywhere the world is opening up , and it &apos;s a good thing .
Anybody got any clues ? Ski . Right .
In the 1960s and 1970s , the Vietnam War was basically shown in America &apos;s living rooms day in , day out .
But I &apos;m not kidding about some of this , and it gets a little bit to the grit issue .
In fact , the architect of our national accounting system , Simon Kuznets , in the 1930s , said that , &quot; A nation &apos;s welfare can scarcely be inferred from their national income . &quot;
In order for us to understand what actually peace means , we need to understand , as one Sudanese woman once told me , &quot; Peace is the fact that my toenails are growing back again . &quot;
You slam them together , and if we are right , some of the energy of that collision will go into debris that flies off into these extra dimensions .
But they get a lot of press because they do a lot of terrible things as well .
Similar data has been around for quite some time .
Your native language is your life .
Alright , this is what it looks like on a good day .
And then re-crafting your life to use them as much as you possibly can .
I can tell you , there isn &apos;t a person in this room that would sit idly by .
And so you see this in junior high a lot .
Why would you choose rats ?

I &apos;m going to share some of these visions with you in a bit , but first I want to take a look at how we got here .
If you haven &apos;t seen one , it &apos;s probably because you didn &apos;t know what to look for -- they &apos;re everywhere . Mounted on roads or on police cars , Automatic License Plate Readers capture images of every passing car and convert the license plate into machine-readable text so that they can be checked against hot lists of cars potentially wanted for wrongdoing .
No , of course you don &apos;t do that ; you put it somewhere in Google .
So in contrast to this very tight grid , we wanted to give these figures a very comical and slapstick-like quality , as if a puppeteer has taken them and physically animated them down the path .

Okay . Some bad news first .
And there &apos;s no magic to creativity in coming up with ideas -- it &apos;s just doing some very simple things .

And he said , &quot; Shanghai is the city in the world with most skyscrapers , &quot; but to him it was as if the connection to the roots had been cut over .
Many of you already must have thought , OK , you can browse .
Instead , what brain imaging has delivered is this rich and interesting picture of the human mind .
So be it the force of self construction , the force of common sense , or the force of nature , all these forces need to be translated into form , and what that form is modeling and shaping is not cement , bricks , or wood .
My head was cut open across the front , lifted back , exposing the skull underneath .

So we &apos;ve engaged not just designers , but also , you know , a whole variety of technology-based professionals .
When are we going to start talking and thinking about shipping miles as well as air miles ?
So you photograph that in exactly the same position , and then you can substitute in -- and that part does use Photoshop -- just the edges .
Ideas can spark a movement .
Just as wings open up this sphere of air for birds to exploit , language opened up the sphere of cooperation for humans to exploit .
The engineering approach simply says , &quot; Let &apos;s go and periodically repair all of these various types of damage -- not necessarily repair them completely , but repair them quite a lot , so that we keep the level of damage down below the threshold that must exist , that causes it to be pathogenic . &quot;
I &apos;m speaking about compassion from an Islamic point of view , and perhaps my faith is not very well thought of as being one that is grounded in compassion .

Well again , by knowing something about the molecular pathways , it was possible to pick one of those many , many compounds that might have been useful and try it out .
It makes it more organic , more natural .
These records were human resource forms .
It &apos;s a hotel that &apos;s only open until midnight , so it &apos;s not a place that you stay .

And on this dating site that I have created , called Chemistry.com , I ask you first a series of questions to see to what degree you express these chemicals , and I &apos;m watching who chooses who to love .
The middle class is spending more on schooling too , but in the global educational arms race that starts at nursery school and ends at Harvard , Stanford or MIT , the 99 percent is increasingly outgunned by the One Percent .
This was a magic box .
Every row is a student .
And then finally , I want to show you some responses that we recorded with the world &apos;s first deep-sea webcam , which we had installed in Monterey Canyon last year .
We are going to actually have to take them off . &quot;
Maybe you thought that was scary , but actually there &apos;s no amount of drugs you can take that can get you as high as if you think you &apos;re Jesus Christ .
Is that conceivable ?
And we intercut it with , &quot; We are the premier science university in the world , &quot; because of British-like hubris .
It is easy to forget the gasp-inducement that occurred in 2007 when you first touched this thing because it became so quickly pervasive and because of how instantly we adopted these gestures and made it an extension of our life .
He died typhoid fever at the age of 44 , I believe , 43 or 44 .
While studying for his PhD in physics , Uri Alon thought he was a failure because all his research paths led to dead ends . But , with the help of improv theater , he came to realize that there could be joy in getting lost . A call for scientists to stop thinking of research as a direct line from question to answer , but as something more creative . It &apos;s a message that will resonate , no matter what your field .
As a statistician , I want people to show me the data so I can decide for myself .
And I often think that they have the best of all worlds .
Last but not least , we found activity in a brain region associated with deep attachment to another individual .
Here we are .
First of all , it &apos;s designed for an information technology that &apos;s over 500 years old .
Yes we can .

So this was an xkcd cartoon from a couple of years ago , and the cartoonist suggests that we should all use pass phrases , and if you look at the second row of this cartoon , you can see the cartoonist is suggesting that the pass phrase &quot; correct horse battery staple &quot; would be a very strong pass phrase and something really easy to remember .

This is still how I largely eat today .
Another even more important difference is that in mass production this would not cost more tomorrow than today &apos;s cell phones could look a lot more stylish than this version that I &apos;m wearing around my neck .

And people ask me , &quot; Lewis , what can we do about climate change ? &quot;
But it &apos;s a lion of the sea . It &apos;s a top predator .
Now in an urban environment , that &apos;s extraordinarily difficult .
This was reinforced by the political climate of the time .
And this is -- you can see -- this is a flapping bird .
It allows them to feel what they &apos;re doing , where they are , and tells them how to act and how to behave .
That &apos;s what happens at academic conferences .
When you try to solve really complex social problems , the right thing to do is most of the time to create the incentives .
All the parts of the document in red are not intelligible .
We can go explore the other side of the Hawaiian Islands .
We could go the other direction and say , well , what are talks that are broadly synthesizing a lot of different kinds of fields .
It was a 7.6 magnitude . It was fairly big .
And how might that change their lives ?
In her mind , she &apos;s still surfing in the ocean .
And lastly , and I think perhaps most importantly , we should be creating materials that fit into what I call nature &apos;s recycling system .
Ariel Garten : Know thyself , with a brain scanner
I walked up to Ashland , Oregon , where they were offering an environmental studies degree .

The Nordic Cochrane Group were trying to get a hold of the data on that to bring it all together .
Schlaug found that his stroke victims who were aphasic , could not form sentences of three- or four-word sentences , but they could still sing the lyrics to a song , whether it was &quot; Happy Birthday To You &quot; or their favorite song by the Eagles or the Rolling Stones .

We were expecting new particles and new phenomena accompanying the Higgs boson .
Of course , it was the same man , but she was seeing him in different ways .
But the way we solve them is with humility -- to abandon the God complex and to actually use a problem-solving technique that works .
I had about 600 milligrams of caffeine , zero of alcohol .
Because you see , if there are other universes , and if those universes each have , say , a different shape for the extra dimensions , then the physical features of each universe will be different , and in particular , the amount of dark energy in each universe will be different .
We could change everything .
When you combine the science of recognizing deception with the art of looking , listening , you exempt yourself from collaborating in a lie .
This is in response to the awful mobile trailers and the outdated textbooks and the terrible materials that we &apos;re building schools out of these days .
Even if you just try to get all of those ideas into your head by watching all those thousand TED videos , it would actually currently take you over 250 hours to do so .
This was after the chaos of the French Revolution .
Autonomous robotic weapons are such a tool , except that , by requiring very few people to go to war , they risk re-centralizing power into very few hands , possibly reversing a five-century trend toward democracy .
And what if we could get exquisite control over the essence of energy , the electron ?
Votes can &apos;t go missing because then you won &apos;t find yours when you look for it .

God forbid .
With trade , there &apos;s mutual interdependency and mutual gain between parties .
It seems to me that there is this latent potential everywhere , all around us .
You begin to see that possibly , the evidence supporting James Lovelock &apos;s Gaia hypothesis , which conceives of the world as a coherent , self-regulating organism , is beginning , at the ecosystem level , to accumulate .
In the words of the Savage , regaining autonomy and freedom is possible , although the price to pay is steep .
This is Donna eating ice cream .
And I thought I was alone in the dark under this tree .
What &apos;s extraordinary is how simple the premise is .
And there are historic attempts that have had some level of technical success .
Every act of communication is , in some way , an act of translation . Onstage at TEDxRainier , writer Chris Bliss thinks hard about the way that great comedy can translate deep truths for a mass audience . &amp; lt ; em &amp; gt ; &amp; lt ; / em &amp; gt ;
I could not believe I had pledged allegiance to research , where our job -- you know , the definition of research is to control and predict , to study phenomena , for the explicit reason to control and predict .
The good projects , which we as a donor community would take under our wings , they took years , you know , you had too many studies , and very often they didn &apos;t succeed .
Whereas the other three piles were dead , dark and stinky , and the PAH &apos;s -- the aromatic hydrocarbons -- went from 10,000 parts per million to less than 200 in eight weeks .
And the way that you know that the answer is dogs is you quickly reviewed in memory the times you &apos;ve seen dogs and pigs on leashes .
You believe that when you have these new technologies and people who are ready to use this , it can make it much more difficult for the governments to lie , it &apos;s going to be more difficult for them to steal and probably even going to be more difficult for them to kill .
Take Leslie Chew , who was a Texas man who stole four blankets on a cold winter night .

The importance of delivering laptops to this region is connecting kids who have otherwise been unconnected because of the FARC , the guerrillas that started off 40 years ago as a political movement and then became a drug movement .
And they were all at a conference in Beijing .
So beyond that , in closing , I &apos;d just like to say that we &apos;re in this era of communications and device proliferation , and it &apos;s really tremendous and exciting and sexy , but I think what &apos;s really important is thinking about how we can simultaneously maintain a sense of wonder and a sense of criticality about the tools that we use and the ways in which we relate to the world .
You know , someone sitting next to you in a seat -- that &apos;s OK because you &apos;re in a theater , but if you were sitting on a park bench and someone came up and sat that close to you , you &apos;d freak out .

So developing nations and first-world nations , imagine if you could take these wild plants and consume them , food miles would basically turn into food feet .
You &apos;ve never seen data presented like this . With the drama and urgency of a sportscaster , statistics guru Hans Rosling debunks myths about the so-called &quot; developing world . &quot;
And it &apos;s getting harder to hide assets , tax avoidance , pay inequality . So that &apos;s great . We &apos;re starting to find out more and more about these systems .
And I &apos;m here to tell you , if there &apos;s anything more intimidating than talking here at TED , it &apos;ll be trying to hold the attention of a group of a thousand 12-year-olds for a 45-minute lecture .
We need to get back to that sense of playfulness and joyfulness and , I would say , nakedness , that has made the Tarahumara one of the healthiest and serene cultures in our time .
Now before we go on , I have a confession to make .
And about four or five months ago , he underwent an experimental procedure .
There are a lot of differences between powerful and powerless people .
Let me tell you a little bit about how languages fundamentally differ .
Here we go . Once again the USA is part of the reason here .
Because the sloth bears in the wild were obviously getting depleted because of this .
And then of course this exaggeration becomes lying , out and out lying , and we don &apos;t want to listen to people we know are lying to us .
And if they said yes , they built it .
The after takes what was four pages -- that previous slide was actually the first of four pages of data that &apos;s just the general blood work .
And the kids , they love it .
That &apos;s exactly the same &#91; one &#93; you saw in the video actually .
When we look at the population growth in terms of cars , it becomes even clearer .
So it didn &apos;t happen . It was a dream that did not happen .
That &apos;s why all of our subdivisions look the same .
We cannot give the data free to the students , free to the entrepreneurs of the world . &quot;
And the third , which was my favorite , was we would promote their embroidery by making a center in the village where women would come every day to make embroidery .
Isn &apos;t it the mind that translates the outer condition into happiness and suffering ?
You turn a faucet and there is warm water and cold water , and drinkable water .
Neither of us had tried to change the other .

The first thing I want to talk about is that when all of this money flowed into our country about 40 years ago , we embarked , the government of the day embarked on a series of government-to-government arrangements to have rapidly develop the country .
Most pianists would have a heart attack if you said , &quot; Sorry , do you mind playing &apos; Flight of the Bumblebee &apos; in B minor instead of A minor ? &quot; as we went on .
And as we already heard , there is a way in which we are trying , and now able , to answer that question .
Here &apos;s how the dots connected .
Test scores are important , but they &apos;re not the most important thing .
And so they decided , because they were intrigued by this finding , to do a nationwide survey .
It &apos;s a medium-sized nucleus .
Either we &apos;re back where we started and the surge has had no effect ; or finally the groups have been fragmented to the extent that we can start to think about maybe moving out .
The doctors and nurses there noticed that she was not only a survivor , she was really clever , and they made her a nurse .
And it was a man , a Chinese man , and he was stacking these things , not with glue , not with anything .
&quot; Don &apos;t mistake legibility for communication . &quot;
This one , of course , still works with the wild dogs .
So of course , when you educate a girl , she tends to get married later on in life , she tends to have kids later on in life , she tends to have fewer kids , and those kids that she does have , she educates them in a more enlightened fashion .
In Kenya , contested presidential elections in 2007 -- we just heard about them -- quickly led to high levels of inter-ethnic violence and the killing and displacement of thousands of people .
These are the guys who wrote the first PC virus .
You heard her , go ahead .
We &apos;ve got all that , but we &apos;ve only got 100 years to enjoy it .
But if you do this , it &apos;s quick .
We can pick up and fly to the deepest place : seven miles down , the Mariana Trench , where only two people have ever been .
And every time you turned up to go on a mission , you got paid in dragon kill points .
Because even if one or two of the non-immune people gets infected , there &apos;s no one for them to infect .
But this is not the only fairytale we tell ourselves about nature .
Intensive farming is depleting soils .
Our architect was covered in red syrup . It looked like he had just murdered somebody , which it was not out of the question for this particular architect , and we didn &apos;t know what to do .
There is no romance involved with gangsters in the 21st Century .
70 percent reduction in violence -- in what everyone said was completely impossible and you couldn &apos;t do .
And that &apos;s where the three kids got arrested , and that &apos;s the grandmother of one of them .
Three and a half minutes longer . Now this makes no sense right ?
It &apos;s just a hollow piece of plastic with an antenna that swivels around .
And now I do that .
I don &apos;t want to talk like they do at the particular DMV that &apos;s close to where Dave lives .
I &apos;d like to talk a little bit more about the brain , because I know you like that here at TED , so if you just give me a minute here , okay .
But it &apos;s not only education .
Audience : Shake . Fold .
See that tail ? That &apos;s incredible !
I want to start with this slide , because this slide sort of tells the story the way Science Magazine thinks of it .
Just think for a moment .
I &apos;ve got a real one in my pocket , if anyone would like to look at it and play with it .
So based on the same logic , I could equally conclude you hate your iPhone .
But just keep staring at it .
Does that mean that you think that the other things we think our brains are about -- the dreaming , the yearning , the falling in love and all these things -- are a kind of side show , an accident ?
I always tell my students , &quot; If you have a deceptive cadence , be sure to raise your eyebrows . Then everybody will know . &quot;

What &apos;s the process by which that could happen ?
Okay , here we go .
You look back on your day , and you &apos;re like , I got nothing done today .
So let &apos;s watch that . Nobody &apos;s ever seen it .
A lot of the funding that I have managed to raise has gone directly to Treatment Action Campaign and the incredible work that they do , and are still continuing to do in South Africa .
But they basically created a digital puppet of her , where you can pull on these various strings , and it actually moves her face in ways that are completely consistent with the scans that we took .
And if that &apos;s not enough , smiling can actually make you look good in the eyes of others .
You had to measure the milk and add it , mixing it .
Halla Tomasdottir : A feminine response to Iceland &apos;s financial crash
And somehow , this is transformed -- the yeast burps and sweats are later transformed -- and this is really getting to the heart of what makes bread so special is that it is a transformational food , and we &apos;re going to explore that in a minute .
So now I &apos;m back to adopting many -- not all ; I don &apos;t wear a helmet anymore -- but dozens of healthy behaviors that I adopted during my year .
And the reason we looked at autism is we had the money to do it .
The retina chip that we designed sits behind this lens here .
DH : It was TED .
Now , when you go back home , if you see a barren piece of land , do remember that it can be a potential forest .
AO : Who is this ?
It &apos;s my belief that abstract economic theory that denies the needs of community or denies the contribution that community makes to economy is shortsighted , cruel and untenable .
Thanks very much .
My son designed a rocket that became stable , a golf ball rocket -- I thought it was quite an interesting experiment in the principles of rocket science -- and it flies straight as an arrow .
But probably even more important is that the work that comes out of these years flows back into the company and into society at large , rather than just benefiting a grandchild or two .
So listen to two mothers speaking motherese -- the universal language we use when we talk to kids -- first in English and then in Japanese .
And I began to think about what I call the &quot; stewardship of affluence &quot; and the &quot; stewardship of influence . &quot;
There &apos;s a chef in Spain named Ferran Adria .
And it makes no difference to their life expectancy at all .
It &apos;s then sold and bought , and it &apos;s then delivered to me .

Some of those grains may then accumulate on a massive scale , into a sand dune .
It &apos;s a children &apos;s book about Indian independence -- very patriotic .
Between six to 14 year-old children participate in a democratic process , and they elect a prime minister .
Think about that for a minute : 1.1 billion dollars , 26 years old .
I was a black angry woman . Oh yeah .
That &apos;s not good . Hi . Yeah . Real bad . Don &apos;t even look at me .
I don &apos;t mean they don &apos;t deserve attention .
The next bit in Siberia to Krasnoyarsk , on a Russian internal airline called KrasAir , spelled K-R-A-S .
What is the essence of journalism if it doesn &apos;t benefit society ?

It doesn &apos;t even tell us in any one child , is it one gene or potentially a combination of genes ?
It serves 220 people a day .
It uploads a picture , and the reason why it chose that cake for you , to our Facebook page and to Twitter .
Can you break your culture of silence ?

They went to the nutritional information box and saw that what works for cereal , works for our food , actually helps people understand what &apos;s in their food .
I Oh , of course . About what ?
And I &apos;m going to be folding one of Robert Lang &apos;s models .
Today I &apos;ll talk about a different approach , which is to put electrodes in different parts of the brain , and actually record the activity of individual nerve cells in the brain .
I came here tonight to tell you that things can be done , that you don &apos;t have always to be rich or powerful to get things on the way , that cities are a great challenge .
That &apos;s all I have . Thank you .
But they &apos;re not strong characters who happen to be female .
But I remained with those people , and I was trying to do something -- &#91; any &#93; little thing I &#91; could &#93; do .
And it really -- it &apos;s almost like doing visual puns all the time .
Well , it &apos;s a good reason .
So after decades of lawsuits and 140 years , now , of experience , we still have this .
Pictures of crowds are particularly interesting , because , you know , you go to that -- you try to figure out the threshold with something you can define very easily , like a face , goes into becoming just a texture .
WK : 12 watts .
So many people would say to us , &quot; What if you just take all that vacant land and you could make it farmland ?
They never really codify it or qualify it or quantify it , and say , &quot; This is what I believe in .
He began to tap on the chests of his patients , on their abdomens .
So this tag actually works out the locations of shark depending on the timing and the setting of the sun , plus water temperature and depth .
Meanwhile , the rich man thinks to himself , &quot; I &apos;m an idiot . God wants bread ?
There &apos;s the phrase called cafeteria religion , and the fundamentalists will use it in a denigrating way , and they &apos;ll say , &quot; Oh , it &apos;s just cafeteria religion .
Here the quad is behaving as if it were in a viscous fluid .

And , in fact , they did it with monkeys .
And every time , we see the same thing .
Man 10 : It &apos;s beautiful .
In her quest to become a world-famous violinist , Ji-Hae Park fell into a severe depression . Only music was able to lift her out again -- showing her that her goal needn &apos;t be to play lofty concert halls , but instead to bring the wonder of the instrument to as many people as possible .
She took her baby to the nearest village clinic , and the doctor advised her to take Rani to a city hospital so she could be placed in an incubator .
After some success , we &apos;ve hit a big hurdle .
It &apos;s cheaper for that person to donate 100,000 dollars every year to the hunger charity , save 50,000 dollars on their taxes , so still be roughly 270,000 dollars a year ahead of the game , now be called a philanthropist because they donated 100,000 dollars to charity , probably sit on the board of the hunger charity , indeed , probably supervise the poor SOB who decided to become the CEO of the hunger charity , and have a lifetime of this kind of power and influence and popular praise still ahead of them .

Now the science behind this is so potent that it became required by the American Board of Surgery in order for a young surgeon to become board certified .
Now , your matzoh balls .
So jogging those zones of familiarity is one way to think about strangeness , and it &apos;s a problem faced not just by individuals today , but also by organizations , organizations that are trying to embrace massively new opportunities .
This is where we want to get , though , in the next three years .
And it occurred to me that in this whole non-governmental world , somebody needs to be thinking about organizing public goods markets .
